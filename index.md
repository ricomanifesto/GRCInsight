# GRC Intelligence Report

Recent security events underscore a heightened regulatory and threat landscape.  U.S. authorities expanded sanctions against North-Korean front companies, while simultaneous Department of Justice indictments highlight increased enforcement on illicit remote-work schemes.  Transportation Security Administration (TSA) guidance draws new attention to traveler cyber-hygiene, and a major Allianz Life data breach activates privacy-law notification duties across the insurance sector.  At the same time, large-scale technical exposures—including a WordPress “Post SMTP” plugin flaw, a maliciously-altered Amazon “Q Developer Extension,” VMware-targeted espionage, and a Microsoft 365 outage—illustrate the prevalence of software-supply-chain, cloud-service, and virtualization risks.  Emerging artificial-intelligence concerns (e.g., AI-generated “Koske” malware and AWS research on logical verification) further elevate governance expectations for boards overseeing AI adoption.  Collectively, organizations must reinforce sanction-screening controls, incident-response playbooks, third-party-risk programs, and executive oversight of AI, privacy, and cyber-resilience.
