# GRC Intelligence Report

Continued geopolitical tension, high-impact data breaches, and an accelerating wave of software vulnerabilities dominated this cycle’s governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) landscape.  Key developments include new U.S. Treasury sanctions targeting a North-Korean threat actor, South Korea’s post-breach enforcement action against its largest mobile carrier, and Microsoft’s disclosure of 130 product vulnerabilities alongside a broken Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) synchronization process that is stalling patch deployment worldwide.  Multiple severe flaws were disclosed in ServiceNow, Ruckus Networks, NVIDIA’s Container Toolkit, and Microsoft Exchange—each illustrating escalating third-party and supply-chain risk.  Large-scale breaches at Qantas (5.7 million customers) and Bitcoin Depot (≈27 000 users) highlight persistent weaknesses in data-protection programs, while emerging threats from AI-generated malware and deep-fake impersonations reinforce the need for stronger board-level oversight of identity, privacy, and sanctions-compliance controls.  Finally, Microsoft’s paid Extended Security Updates (ESU) pathway for Windows 10 and Apple-centric backup changes for Microsoft Authenticator introduce new compliance tasks for IT and audit teams tracking end-of-support software and credential-management policies.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

### U.S. Treasury OFAC Sanctions – Song Kum Hyok / Andariel Hacking Group
- **Description**: The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned North-Korean national Song Kum Hyok for facilitating malware-enabled fraudulent IT-worker schemes linked to the Andariel threat group.  
- **Impact**: U.S. persons and organizations must block property and interests of the sanctioned individual, cease transactions, and update sanctions-screening tools. Violations carry civil/criminal penalties.  
- **Timeline**: Sanctions took effect immediately upon public notice (date specified in article).  
- **Affected Industries**: All sectors engaging in international payments or hiring remote IT freelancers.  
- **Regulatory Body**: U.S. Department of the Treasury – OFAC.

### South Korean Government Enforcement – SK Telecom Breach Response
- **Description**: Following a breach exposing 27 million customer records, regulators levied a monetary penalty and imposed additional, stricter regulatory requirements on SK Telecom to strengthen security controls.  
- **Impact**: Telecom providers operating in South Korea must prepare for heightened compliance monitoring, mandatory remediation actions, and potential follow-up audits.  
- **Timeline**: Enforcement measures announced directly after breach disclosure. Specific audit/compliance dates to be communicated by authorities.  
- **Affected Industries**: Telecommunications and any critical-infrastructure operators within South Korea.  
- **Regulatory Body**: South Korean government (ministry not named in article).

### Microsoft Windows 10 – Extended Security Updates (ESU) Program
- **Description**: Microsoft confirmed that Windows 10 reaches end of support in October 2025 and unveiled a paid ESU subscription for continued security updates; special concessions apply to education customers, and—for the first time—consumers are eligible.  
- **Impact**: Organizations relying on Windows 10 must budget for ESU subscriptions, migrate to supported OS versions, or accept unmitigated security risk—affecting patch-management policies and asset-life-cycle controls.  
- **Timeline**: Standard support ends October 2025; ESU Year 1 starts immediately thereafter, with options through at least October 2026.  
- **Affected Industries**: All sectors with Windows 10 deployments (notably healthcare, manufacturing, and public sector where legacy devices persist).  
- **Regulatory Body**: Vendor policy (Microsoft) – indirectly influences regulatory compliance where “supported software” is mandated (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA).
