# GRC Intelligence Report

During the period under review, cyber-regulatory activity was dominated by U.S. federal directives to remediate freshly exploited software flaws, intensified global ransomware advisories, and the debut of a controversial national digital-identity scheme in China. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) expanded its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog to include two critical Microsoft SharePoint flaws (CVE-2025-49704, CVE-2025-49706) and two high-risk SysAid service-desk vulnerabilities, ordering immediate patching across federal civilian agencies and recommending the same for the private sector. CISA and the FBI also issued a joint alert on escalating Interlock ransomware campaigns. In parallel, multiple security researchers confirmed active exploitation of SharePoint bugs by at least three China-based nation-state actors, the resurgence of the Lumma infostealer operation, and a new “Coyote” banking-trojan variant abusing Windows accessibility features. Microsoft released the Windows 11 KB5062660 preview update as part of its “Windows Resilience Initiative,” introducing automated recovery and security-hardening capabilities designed to lessen operational risk. On the governance front, China launched a voluntary “National Cyber ID” program, triggering privacy concerns and raising questions about cross-border data-transfer compliance. Finally, a significant data breach at AMEOS Group highlighted ongoing exposure of personal health information under EU data-protection rules, while TSA guidance cautioned travelers against unsafe airport Wi-Fi and USB charging ports, underscoring persistent end-user security risks.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

- **Timeline**: Advisory released 22 July 2025; guidance effective immediately.  
- **Affected Industries**: Broad—energy, manufacturing, healthcare, and professional services noted as primary targets.  
- **Regulatory Body**: CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

### China National Cyber ID Program
- **Description**: China rolled out a voluntary Internet identity credential aimed at “protecting citizens’ online identities,” though critics warn of expanded state surveillance.  
- **Impact**: Multinational firms processing Chinese citizens’ data must assess privacy implications and potential alignment with existing consent mechanisms.  
- **Timeline**: National launch announced July 2025; no sunset date provided.  
- **Affected Industries**: All digital-service providers operating in or serving users located in China.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC).
