# GRC Intelligence Report

Recent security research and breach disclosures underline a sharp rise in supply-chain exploitation, insider threats, and nation-state espionage. The compromise of ConnectWise ScreenConnect by AsyncRAT operators, a record-setting 1.5 Bpps DDoS against a European mitigation provider, and the largest supply-chain attack ever recorded in the NPM ecosystem highlight the expanding attack surface created by third-party software and cloud services. Meanwhile, Jaguar Land Rover’s confirmed data theft and Anthropic’s warning about a new Claude feature reinforce continuing privacy- and AI-governance challenges. On the defensive side, Google’s integration of C2PA content-provenance credentials into the Pixel 10, and Apple’s memory-safety hardening in the iPhone 17, signal an industry shift toward embedded security controls that align with emerging authenticity and spyware-resilience expectations. Collectively, these developments require organizations to tighten breach-notification procedures, strengthen software-supply-chain controls, refine AI-governance models, and expand board-level oversight of cyber-risk.

## Risk Management Developments

| Risk Area | Assessment Methods | Mitigation Strategies |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| RMM Exploitation | Continuous attack-surface monitoring; penetration testing of management ports | Disable unused RMM agents, enforce code-signing for scripts, and deploy EDR with behavioral analytics |
| Massive DDoS (1.5 Bpps) | Stress testing vs. volumetric thresholds; scrubbing-capacity audits | Multi-region scrubbing centers, anycast routing, and contractual surge capacity in SLAs |
| Supply-Chain (NPM, Cursor AI) | SBOM analysis; dependency-conflict scanning | Quarantine unverified repos, apply SLSA level 3+ build pipelines, and sandbox IDE autorun features |
| Insider Threats in Education | User-behavior analytics; privilege reviews for student accounts | Mandatory cybersecurity training, graduated access rights, and automated detection of anomalous data transfers |
| Nation-State Espionage (EggStreme malware, lawmaker impersonation) | Threat-intelligence correlation; phishing-simulation metrics | TTP-based IOC blocking, advanced email authentication (DMARC, DKIM), and hardware-based endpoint isolation |
| AI Feature Data Leakage | Data-mapping for AI integrations; model-output monitoring | Role-based data redaction, policy-based blocking of sensitive uploads, and human-in-the-loop verification |
