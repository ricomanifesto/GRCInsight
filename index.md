# GRC Intelligence Report

The past week’s security bulletin highlights a sharp uptick in critical-severity software vulnerabilities, renewed ransomware activity, and expanded federal patch-mandate pressure. CISA gave U.S. civilian agencies just 24 hours to remediate the newly exploited Citrix Bleed 2 flaw (CVE-2025-5777), while multiple vendors—including Fortinet, Wing FTP, and NVIDIA—published urgent mitigation guidance following weaponized exploits. Supply-chain integrity risks remain prominent: a compromised Gravity Forms distribution channel, an OpenVSX zero-day, and leaked Laravel APP_KEYs collectively expose thousands of downstream customers. Automotive, industrial, and consumer IoT manufacturers must contend with “PerfektBlue,” a Bluetooth RCE chain affecting an estimated 350 million vehicles and one billion devices. Simultaneously, the Pay2Key ransomware-as-a-service re-emerged with larger profit shares, and cyber-insurance experts warn that falling premiums should not deter continued investment in coverage. Boards and executive leadership—particularly in the financial sector—are being urged to integrate cybersecurity into digital-transformation roadmaps, enforce stronger credential hygiene (e.g., passkeys over passwords), and strengthen data-governance controls for AI-driven environments.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

### CISA Addition of CVE-2025-5777 (“Citrix Bleed 2”) to KEV Catalog
- **Description**: The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added Citrix NetScaler ADC/Gateway vulnerability CVE-2025-5777 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog after confirming active exploitation.
- **Impact**: All U.S. federal civilian executive-branch agencies must apply the vendor patch or discontinue affected products until mitigated.
- **Timeline**: Agencies were granted a 24-hour window from the CISA notification to achieve remediation.
- **Affected Industries**: Federal agencies primarily; enterprises running Citrix NetScaler secondarily.
- **Regulatory Body**: CISA

*No other articles disclosed new statutes, regulations, or framework version changes.*
