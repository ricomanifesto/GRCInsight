# GRC Intelligence Report

Recent reporting underscores an increasingly urgent operating environment for security and compliance teams. A critical, no-workaround vulnerability in Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center requires immediate patching to maintain security baselines, while Microsoft’s formal retirement notice for Windows 10 sets a near-term clock for operating-system governance and asset-lifecycle programs. Nation-state and criminal actors continue to escalate: Crypto24 ransomware demonstrates sophisticated EDR-evasion techniques; coordinated Russian-linked campaigns are targeting European water and wastewater infrastructure; and telecom provider Colt is recovering from a disruptive ransomware incident that has already led to data-exfiltration claims. Concurrently, mobile-phishing crews are pivoting to brokerage accounts in large-scale “ramp-and-dump” cash-out schemes, highlighting evolving fraud risks to the financial sector. Thought-leadership pieces stress that embedding cybersecurity expertise in executive decision-making materially improves business outcomes, signalling a governance shift toward deeper board-level engagement. Collectively, the developments require accelerated patch and migration programs, renewed incident-response readiness, enhanced supply-chain and OT risk controls, and stronger cross-functional governance.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

### Microsoft Windows 10 Retirement Notice  
- **Description**: Microsoft reiterated that all editions of Windows 10 (version 22H2) reach end of servicing on October 14. After that date, the operating system will no longer receive security updates unless organisations purchase an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription.  
- **Impact**: Enterprises must complete migration to Windows 11 or implement ESU to maintain patch-level compliance. Asset inventories, configuration baselines, and vulnerability-management scopes must be updated to remove or isolate unsupported systems.  
- **Timeline**: End of servicing on October 14 (two months from the reminder notice).  
- **Affected Industries**: All sectors running Windows 10 endpoints, servers, or kiosks.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Microsoft (vendor‐issued lifecycle requirement).

### National Advisories on Water & Wastewater System Security  
- **Description**: Cybersecurity authorities in Norway and Poland publicly attributed recent intrusions on municipal water infrastructure to Russian threat actors, issuing joint advisories urging immediate hardening of operational technology (OT) environments.  
- **Impact**: Water utilities are expected to review remote-access pathways, segment IT/OT networks, and implement continuous monitoring. The advisories also raise the likelihood of stricter sector oversight and mandatory reporting.  
- **Timeline**: Advisories are active; no specific compliance deadline cited.  
- **Affected Industries**: Water and wastewater utilities, broader critical-infrastructure operators.  
- **Regulatory Body**: National security and cyber-defence agencies of Norway and Poland.

### Sector Notice: Telecom Resiliency & Breach Reporting (Colt Incident)  
- **Description**: Following a multi-day ransomware disruption at UK-based Colt Technology Services, telecom regulators and industry bodies are scrutinising business-continuity and customer-data protections across the sector.  
- **Impact**: Providers should validate ransomware-playbooks, assess supply-chain dependencies, and re-examine breach-notification workflows to ensure timely disclosure.  
- **Timeline**: Investigation ongoing; regulator enquiries commenced immediately after incident disclosure.  
- **Affected Industries**: Telecommunications carriers, managed-service providers, hosting operators.  
- **Regulatory Body**: UK telecom and data-protection authorities (agency names not specified in article).

## Risk Management Developments

- **Risk Area**: Zero-Day & Critical Vulnerabilities  
  - Assessment Methods: CVSS scoring, exploit-availability analysis, patch-aging metrics.  
  - Mitigation Strategies: 48-hour maximum patch-window for CVSS 9.0+, automated configuration management, and pre-production patch testing.

- **Risk Area**: Ransomware with EDR-Evasion (Crypto24)  
  - Assessment Methods: Purple-team exercises emulating process-kill and driver-load tactics.  
  - Mitigation Strategies: Kernel-level tamper protection, immutable backups, and network-segmentation around high-value assets.

- **Risk Area**: Supply-Chain & Service-Provider Disruptions (Colt)  
  - Assessment Methods: Third-party risk scoring, SLA dependency mapping.  
  - Mitigation Strategies: Contractual breach-notification clauses, multi-provider redundancy, and tabletop exercises with vendors.

- **Risk Area**: OT & Critical-Infrastructure Intrusions  
  - Assessment Methods: OT asset discovery, attack-path mapping, and threat-intel correlation.  
  - Mitigation Strategies: Purdue-model segmentation, secure-remote-access gateways, and 24×7 ICS SOC monitoring.
