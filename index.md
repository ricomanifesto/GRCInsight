# GRC Intelligence Report

Over the last news cycle, several technology and cybersecurity stories carry direct Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) implications. Microsoft’s August 2025 Patch Tuesday delivered 107 security fixes—one a Windows Kerberos zero-day—reinforcing vulnerability-management imperatives. Google announced that Android’s protected KVM (pKVM) achieved SESIP Level 5 certification, offering a new benchmark for mobile-platform assurance. Concurrently, supply-chain risk resurfaced as researchers found at least 35 Docker Hub images still tainted with the XZ-Utils backdoor more than a year after discovery. Threat activity accelerated: Fortinet SSL VPNs were hit by a global brute-force campaign, cyber-extortion groups ShinyHunters and Scattered Spider teamed up to target Salesforce tenants, and the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) seized more than $1 million in cryptocurrency from the BlackSuit ransomware gang. Governance discussions emerged around Reddit’s decision to block Internet Archive crawlers—highlighting data-use policy enforcement—and the Linux community’s quality-control dispute prompted by Linus Torvalds’ rebuke of “garbage” kernel patches. Collectively, the developments underscore heightened regulatory scrutiny, the necessity of disciplined software-supply-chain controls, and the expanding attack surface across VPN, container, and cloud ecosystems.
