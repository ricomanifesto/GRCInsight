# GRC Intelligence Report

Recent security advisories highlight intensifying cyber-threat activity and the need for rapid patch management, while new operating-system “resilience” capabilities aim to reduce downtime and strengthen business continuity. Key government bodies—the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)—issued fresh guidance on ransomware, critical infrastructure protection, and safe use of public Wi-Fi and charging stations. Vendors Microsoft and Cisco disclosed serious vulnerabilities and released mitigations, and a major Central-European healthcare provider reported a data breach that may affect customers, employees, and partners. Collectively, these developments reinforce heightened board-level oversight requirements, tighter incident-response timelines, and renewed emphasis on third-party and supply-chain risk management.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

### CISA / FBI Joint Advisory – Interlock Ransomware Activity
- **Description**: Alert on increased double-extortion attacks using Interlock ransomware against businesses and critical infrastructure.  
- **Impact**: Organizations should update incident-response plans, apply indicator-of-compromise (IOC) monitoring, and strengthen data-backup strategies.  
- **Timeline**: Advisory released Tuesday (date in article). No explicit compliance deadline, but immediate action urged.  
- **Affected Industries**: Broad—critical infrastructure operators, commercial enterprises.  
- **Regulatory Body**: U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

### TSA Guidance – Safe Use of Airport Wi-Fi and Charging Ports
- **Description**: TSA reminder about risks of public Wi-Fi and USB charging (“juice-jacking”) at airports.  
- **Impact**: Travelers and corporate mobile-workforce programs should enforce VPN usage, disable auto-connect, and favor personal power adapters.  
- **Timeline**: Guidance currently in force; no stated deadline.  
- **Affected Industries**: Air-travel ecosystem, enterprises with frequent traveler employees.  
- **Regulatory Body**: U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA).

### Cisco Security Advisory – Identity Services Engine (ISE) Critical RCE Flaws
- **Description**: Cisco confirmed active exploitation of three previously patched remote-code-execution vulnerabilities that allow unauthenticated root access.  
- **Impact**: Mandatory patching of all affected ISE and ISE-PIC deployments; enable threat-detection logging and network segmentation.  
- **Timeline**: Advisory updated Monday (date in article); patches already available.  
- **Affected Industries**: Any organization using Cisco ISE—prevalent in finance, government, healthcare, and critical infrastructure.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Cisco (vendor security advisory).

## Compliance Requirements and Obligations

- **Apply Windows 11 KB5062660 “Windows Resilience” Update**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: Internal IT security baselines / patch-management policy  
  - **Implementation Details**: Deploy preview update to Windows 11 24H2 environments to enable automatic recovery tools and new health checks.

- **Immediate Patching of Cisco ISE Critical RCE Vulnerabilities**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: Vendor-supplied security advisories; aligns with vulnerability-management programs (e.g., ISO 27001 A.12.6)  
  - **Implementation Details**: Install Cisco-provided firmware/software updates, validate successful remediation, and document in vulnerability register.

- **Monitor and Mitigate Interlock Ransomware IOCs**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: NIST CSF “Detect” and “Respond” categories; CISA Alert directives  
  - **Implementation Details**: Ingest CISA-supplied IOCs into SIEM, conduct threat-hunting, test backups, and rehearse ransomware playbooks.

- **Enforce Secure Mobile-Worker Practices at Transportation Hubs**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: Corporate mobile-device security policy  
  - **Implementation Details**: Mandate VPN, disable USB data pins with charge-only cables, and communicate TSA guidance to staff.

- **Enhance Banking-Site Controls Against Coyote Malware**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: Financial-sector malware-defense guidelines  
  - **Implementation Details**: Update endpoint-protection signatures, monitor accessibility-framework abuse, and apply browser-hardening GPOs.

## Risk Management Developments

- **Operational Resilience (Windows Resilience Initiative)**  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Review mean-time-to-recover metrics post-update installation.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Deploy new auto-repair and rollback features to decrease outage duration.

- **Ransomware (Interlock)**  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Use CISA IOCs, conduct gap analysis of existing ransomware controls.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Implement immutable backups, network segmentation, and multi-factor authentication.

- **Critical Vulnerabilities (Cisco ISE RCE)**  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Asset inventory to locate vulnerable ISE instances; CVSS-based prioritization.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Accelerated patching, temporary access controls, continuous monitoring for exploit attempts.

- **Malware Targeting Accessibility Frameworks (Coyote Banking Trojan)**  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Behavioral analytics to detect unusual UI Automation API calls.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Restrict unnecessary accessibility features, reinforce endpoint detection-and-response (EDR) tooling.

- **Supply-Chain / Third-Party Risk (Dell Customer Solution Center Breach)**  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Evaluate vendor-data segregation practices and review breach notifications.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Update third-party due-diligence questionnaires; require evidence of synthetic-data controls where applicable.

## Governance and Oversight Changes

- **Board-Level Cyber-Risk Oversight**  
  - **Requirements**: Brief boards on CISA/FBI ransomware advisory and Cisco ISE exploitation trends.  
  - **Accountability**: CISO and Risk Committee to ensure timely patching and incident-response readiness.

- **Incident-Disclosure Procedures (AMEOS Healthcare Breach)**  
  - **Requirements**: Formalize breach-communication protocols to customers, employees, and partners.  
  - **Accountability**: Chief Privacy Officer and Legal.

- **Technology Acquisition Governance (Darktrace–Mira Security)**  
  - **Requirements**: Integrate acquired decryption capabilities into enterprise network-visibility strategy.  
  - **Accountability**: CTO and M&A Integration Steering Committee.

## Industry-Specific Impacts
