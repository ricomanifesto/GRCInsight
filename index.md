# GRC Intelligence Report

During this cycle, cybersecurity-driven regulatory guidance and vendor-mandated controls dominated the GRC landscape. European regulators tightened technology-sovereignty rules (Czech NÚKIB ban on Chinese tech), while U.S. oversight agencies signaled scrutiny of content-filtering algorithms (FTC letter to Google). Vendors also moved the compliance goalpost: Microsoft made multifactor authentication mandatory in Azure Portal, and SAP customers were urged to patch a critical S/4HANA flaw already under active exploitation. High-volume supply-chain compromises (GitHub “s1ngularity,” malicious npm packages) and novel phishing vectors (iCloud Calendar, SVG-based lures, Operation BarrelFire) reinforced the need for rigorous third-party risk management. Meanwhile, emerging best practice discussions focused on agentic-AI “toxic flow” assessments and evolving IoT security statutes. Collectively, these developments require boards and compliance leaders to re-evaluate access controls, supplier vetting, and sector-specific technology choices.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

### Czech NÚKIB Instruction on Chinese Technology in Critical Infrastructure
- **Description**: The Czech National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NÚKIB) issued formal guidance instructing critical infrastructure operators to avoid using Chinese hardware, software, or cloud services, and to cease transferring user data to territories under Chinese jurisdiction.  
- **Impact**: Organizations must map existing assets, conduct supplier due-diligence, and phase out non-compliant technology; procurement policies should be updated to prohibit Chinese vendors.  
- **Timeline**: Immediate effect; no grace period was stated but NÚKIB stressed “urgent action.”  
- **Affected Industries**: All 13 legally designated critical-infrastructure sectors in the Czech Republic (energy, finance, health, transportation, etc.).  
- **Regulatory Body**: National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NUKIB), Czech Republic.

### Microsoft Mandatory MFA for Azure Portal
- **Description**: Microsoft confirmed that multifactor authentication has been *enforced* for all Azure Portal sign-ins across every tenant since March 2025.  
- **Impact**: Tenants must ensure user accounts are MFA-enabled and align internal policies with Microsoft’s security defaults; legacy authentication must be disabled.  
- **Timeline**: Enforcement began March 2025; already live.  
- **Affected Industries**: All sectors using Microsoft Azure.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Vendor policy (Microsoft) – treated as de-facto compliance obligation for cloud customers.

### Federal Trade Commission Inquiry Into Gmail Spam Filtering
- **Description**: The FTC chair sent a formal letter to Google requesting justification for Gmail’s political-mail filtering practices amid allegations of partisan bias.  
- **Impact**: Potential for future FTC guidance or enforcement on algorithmic transparency; organizations relying on large-scale email campaigns must prepare evidence of CAN-SPAM compliance and filtering neutrality.  
- **Timeline**: Inquiry launched last week; no deadlines yet.  
- **Affected Industries**: Political organizations, advertising platforms, email service providers.  
- **Regulatory Body**: U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

### Emerging IoT Security Statutes (Multiple Jurisdictions)
- **Description**: Experts cited new national and regional laws over the past five years aimed at improving IoT device security (e.g., secure-by-design mandates, labeling schemes).  
- **Impact**: Manufacturers must integrate baseline security controls (password requirements, patchability) and provide software-support life-cycle disclosures.  
- **Timeline**: Varies by jurisdiction; most recent rules are entering force between 2024-2026.  
- **Affected Industries**: IoT device manufacturers, smart-home vendors, industrial-control suppliers.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Not specified (multiple national regulators).

## Risk Management Developments

- **Phishing via Legitimate Services**  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Monitor calendar invite traffic, analyze email-header authenticity.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Disable auto-add for external calendar invites; deploy DMARC and zero-trust email gateways.

  - **Assessment Methods**: Continuous code-repository monitoring, dependency-track scans.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Enforce least-privilege PAT scopes, implement 2FA for developers, use vetted package mirrors.

- **Critical ERP Vulnerabilities (SAP S/4HANA)**  
  - **Assessment Methods**: CVE scanning, configuration compliance checks.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Prompt patching, network segmentation of SAP hosts, privilege-separation for service accounts.

- **State-Aligned APT Activity (Operation BarrelFire, CastleRAT)**  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Threat-hunt for TTP overlap, log correlation in SIEM.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Geo-IP blocking, multi-layered email filtering, staff spear-phishing awareness.
