# GRC Intelligence Report

Over the last week, threat-centric developments clearly outweighed formal regulatory rule-making. U.S. and EU security authorities issued urgent alerts about actively exploited software flaws, two critical mobile-platform zero-days were patched by Samsung and Apple, and researchers disclosed a new “HybridPetya” ransomware strain that subverts UEFI Secure Boot.  At the same time, Microsoft announced an imminent end-of-support milestone for Windows 11 23H2; the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) flagged undocumented radios in solar-powered highway equipment, underscoring continuing supply-chain risk in operational technology; and the FDA cleared Apple’s forthcoming Hypertension Detection feature, adding a new compliance obligation for digital-health stakeholders.  Finally, an intellectual-property enforcement case (57-month prison sentence for film piracy) and new research exposing weak privacy practices in several free VPN services highlight the growing enforcement and due-diligence expectations facing consumer-tech providers.
