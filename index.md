# GRC Intelligence Report

Recent security disclosures and threat-intelligence articles highlight a sharp rise in ransomware–driven data-exfiltration, exploitable software vulnerabilities, and emerging attack surfaces in generative-AI systems. Key developments include a confirmed customer-data breach at UK telecom provider Colt, critical remote-code-execution flaws in Commvault backup software, and a downgrade attack that weakens ChatGPT’s built-in security controls. Law-enforcement agency Europol was also impersonated in a fake $50,000 “reward” scheme, underscoring the governance risk of brand spoofing. Meanwhile, researchers detail how threat actors weaponize legitimate VPS infrastructure for rapid, low-cost campaigns, and how “ClickFix” social-engineering lures deploy a new CORNFLAKE.V3 backdoor. Operational guidance stresses stronger board-level oversight of AI risk, tighter patch-management for backup platforms, and upgraded help-desk processes to counter MFA social-engineering. Collectively, these issues demand immediate attention to incident-response planning, third-party-risk governance, and AI-specific control frameworks.

- **Timeline**: Feedback window opened immediately; no closure date announced.  
- **Affected Industries**: All Windows-dependent sectors.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Microsoft (vendor communication).
