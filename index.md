# GRC Intelligence Report

In the past week, threat intelligence feeds and cybersecurity news outlets have highlighted an unusual concentration of software-supply-chain compromises (npm packages, WordPress plugins, VSCode extensions, Laravel keys, and Git repository leaks), a series of critical zero-day vulnerabilities affecting widely deployed technologies (Gigabyte UEFI firmware, Fortinet FortiWeb, Wing FTP, Bluetooth “PerfektBlue,” Google Gemini prompt injection, NVIDIA “GPUHammer,” and Kigen eSIM cards), and new malware delivery techniques (Interlock “FileFix” and XORIndex).  Regulatory and governance headlines were led by the U.K. National Cyber Security Centre’s new Vulnerability Research Initiative (VRI) and an international law-enforcement takedown of a £390 K tech-support scam by India’s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).  At the strategic-risk level, cyber-insurance premiums are declining while requirements tighten, forcing boards to revisit risk-transfer strategies.  Collectively, these developments reinforce the need for stronger software-bill-of-materials (SBOM) controls, continuous vulnerability disclosure programs, multifactor authentication (especially passkeys), and a more mature insider-risk and third-party-risk governance model.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

### U.K. National Cyber Security Centre – Vulnerability Research Initiative (VRI)
- **Description**: The NCSC launched the VRI to formalize cooperation with external security researchers, offering incentives and structured channels for responsible disclosure that target critical U.K. systems.
- **Impact**: U.K. organizations operating critical infrastructure should register disclosure contacts, update vulnerability-handling playbooks, and ensure timely remediation to meet VRI expectations.
- **Timeline**: Program announced immediately; detailed participation windows to be published by NCSC.
- **Affected Industries**: Critical National Infrastructure (energy, finance, healthcare, transportation), government suppliers, and SaaS providers servicing the public sector.
- **Regulatory Body**: U.K. National Cyber Security Centre (part of GCHQ).

### India Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) – Tech-Support Scam Enforcement Action
- **Description**: CBI dismantled a transnational cybercrime ring running a £390 K tech-support scam targeting U.K. citizens, arresting key operators and seizing call-center infrastructure.
- **Impact**: Demonstrates heightened cross-border enforcement; companies outsourcing call-center or support operations must verify vendor compliance with anti-fraud controls and maintain audit trails.
- **Timeline**: Raids and arrests completed this week; ongoing investigation may trigger further notices.
- **Affected Industries**: Business-process outsourcing (BPO), telecom, and any enterprise using third-party tech-support vendors.
- **Regulatory Body**: Central Bureau of Investigation, India (co-operating with U.K. law enforcement).

### U.S. Government Security Clearance Oversight (Implied by DOGE Insider Incident)
- **Description**: Leak of an API key by a Department of Government Efficiency employee exposed access to sensitive SSA and Treasury data. While not a formal rule change, the incident is expected to prompt tighter access-control reviews across U.S. federal agencies.
- **Impact**: Agencies must validate least-privilege controls, API-key governance, and insider-risk monitoring for cleared personnel.
- **Timeline**: Immediate incident response; potential policy updates pending internal review.
- **Affected Industries**: Federal government departments and contractors with privileged data access.
- **Regulatory Body**: Anticipated oversight from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and agency Inspectors General.
