# GRC Intelligence Report

Recent cybersecurity incidents and vendor support announcements are driving urgent governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) actions across multiple industries. A ransomware breach at venture-capital giant Insight Partners, a credential-exposure incident at SonicWall, and the disruption of the “RaccoonO365” Phishing-as-a-Service ring illustrate the accelerating threat landscape and the regulatory pressure to report, remediate, and notify affected parties. Simultaneously, Microsoft confirmed end-of-support timelines for Windows 10 as well as Office 2016 and Office 2019, forcing organizations to accelerate upgrade plans or face non-compliance with security-control frameworks that prohibit the use of unsupported software. Evolving threat actor tradecraft (TA415, MetaStealer, Raven Stealer) and AI-enabled fraud schemes are expanding risk registers, while emerging guidance on AI data-security controls highlights governance expectations for safe AI adoption. Collectively, these developments require strengthened board oversight, updated risk assessments, and swift compliance implementation across data-protection, software-lifecycle, and incident-response domains.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

### End-of-Support for Microsoft Office 2016 & Office 2019
- **Description**: Microsoft reiterated that both suites exit extended support on 14 October 2025, after which no security patches will be provided.  
- **Impact**: Organizations must migrate to supported Office editions (e.g., Microsoft 365 Apps, Office LTSC 2025) or risk falling out of alignment with security baselines that require vendor-supported software.  
- **Timeline**: End of support – 14 October 2025.  
- **Affected Industries**: All sectors running the legacy suites.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Not a government body; vendor-driven lifecycle with downstream compliance implications under multiple cyber-hygiene frameworks.

### Windows 10 Support Retirement (Consumer Reports Critique)
- **Description**: Consumer Reports criticized Microsoft’s 2025 Windows 10 retirement plan, claiming inadequate notice for millions of users on unsupported hardware.  
- **Impact**: Enterprises must budget for hardware refreshes or extended security-update programs to remain compliant with internal and external security requirements.  
- **Timeline**: Core Windows 10 support ends October 2025; no alternate dates were changed in the article.  
- **Affected Industries**: All Windows-dependent environments.  
- **Regulatory Body**: N/A (vendor policy influences compliance posture).

### Insight Partners Ransomware Breach – Statutory Notification
- **Description**: Personal data of thousands of individuals was exfiltrated by ransomware actors; the firm issued breach notifications in multiple U.S. jurisdictions.  
- **Impact**: Triggers data-breach disclosure duties, credit-monitoring offers, and enhanced security-control attestations to limited partners and regulators.  
- **Timeline**: Notifications currently underway; no specific statutory deadline cited.  
- **Affected Industries**: Financial services (venture capital/private equity).  
- **Regulatory Body**: State attorneys general (U.S.) and any applicable data-protection authorities referenced in individual notifications.

### SonicWall MySonicWall Credential Exposure
- **Description**: Backup-file exposure forced SonicWall to instruct customers to reset passwords and enable MFA.  
- **Impact**: Customers must comply with breach-notification clauses in their own contracts and evidence configuration security to regulators or auditors.  
- **Timeline**: Immediate password-reset guidance issued; no specific end date.  
- **Affected Industries**: Organizations using SonicWall security appliances (public and private sectors).  
- **Regulatory Body**: N/A (vendor advisory with downstream regulatory consequences).

## Compliance Requirements and Obligations

- **Software-Lifecycle Management**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: ISO 27001, NIST CSF, SOC 2 (all reference use of supported software).  
  - **Implementation Details**: Inventory legacy Windows 10 and Office instances; create phased migration plans or obtain paid extended security updates.

- **Incident & Breach Notification**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: State data-breach statutes, GDPR equivalence where applicable.  
  - **Implementation Details**: Activate incident-response playbooks; deliver notifications to impacted individuals and regulators within required statutory windows; document corrective actions.

- **Credential Hygiene & MFA Enforcement**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: CIS Controls, PCI DSS password standards.  
  - **Implementation Details**: Mandatory password resets, enforcement of MFA for MySonicWall accounts, and certificate rotation for exposed configurations.

- **Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) Updates**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: Shared Assessments, SIG.  
  - **Implementation Details**: Reassess vendor security (SonicWall, Microsoft) for lifecycle and breach impacts; update risk scores and contract clauses.

- **AI Data-Security Controls**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: Emerging AI governance guidelines (no specific version named).  
  - **Implementation Details**: Implement data-classification, access-control, and model-monitoring safeguards before deploying generative-AI tools in production environments.

## Risk Management Developments

- **Ransomware & Data-Exfiltration**  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Table-top exercises, RPO/RTO validation, compromise-assessment scans.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Immutable backups, EDR with behavioral analytics, enhanced offline key management.

- **Credential Phishing-as-a-Service (RaccoonO365)**  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Phishing-simulation metrics, email-gateway efficacy reviews.
