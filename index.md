# GRC Intelligence Report

The current threat landscape is dominated by state-sponsored espionage campaigns, critical zero-day exploits, and emerging legal actions that shape governance, risk, and compliance priorities. Key developments include the UK’s formal attribution of a Microsoft 365 credential-theft campaign to Russia’s GRU (APT28), Google’s civil action against operators of the BADBOX 2.0 botnet, and multiple high-impact vulnerabilities affecting Ivanti, NVIDIA’s container stack, Gigabyte firmware, and TeleMessage’s SGNL platform. In parallel, national authorities (CERT-UA, Japanese Police, UK NCSC) are issuing technical advisories and remediation tools, while security researchers highlight new attack techniques that bypass FIDO-based MFA and exploit weak or absent authentication in MCP servers powering agentic AI. Organizations must intensify patch-management cycles, recalibrate MFA programs, and reinforce board-level oversight of AI and supply-chain security to remain compliant with evolving regulatory expectations and to mitigate heightened operational and reputational risks.
