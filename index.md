# GRC Intelligence Report

The past week’s security news cycle highlights a surge in vulnerability disclosures, supply-chain software weaknesses, and high-profile data breaches, prompting fresh guidance from regulators and new expectations for governance teams. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) expanded its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog to include a critical Citrix NetScaler flaw, effectively setting an accelerated patch timetable for U.S. government systems and raising the bar for private-sector remediation. Meanwhile, the FBI reiterated Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) password, MFA, and access-control rules, underscoring mandatory controls for any organization that handles law-enforcement data. Multiple incidents—including a 5.7-million-record breach at Qantas, a ransomware outage at Ingram Micro, and arrests tied to the “Scattered Spider” extortion group—reinforce the importance of breach-response governance and supply-chain risk oversight. Finally, emerging technology themes—AI model integrations (MCP), widespread eSIM and Bluetooth stack vulnerabilities, and the transition to passkeys—signal evolving compliance and risk-management considerations that boards should track closely.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

### CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) – Addition of CVE-2025-5777
- **Description**: CISA added a critical Citrix NetScaler ADC & Gateway remote-code-execution flaw (CVE-2025-5777) to its KEV catalog due to active exploitation in the wild.
- **Impact**: Federal civilian executive-branch agencies must inventory affected appliances, apply vendor-provided patches or mitigation steps, and report completion through existing CISA channels. Private enterprises are strongly urged to mirror the remediation timeline.
- **Timeline**: Specific patch-by dates were not listed in the article, but KEV inclusions generally carry short (often 7- to 21-day) federal deadlines.
- **Affected Industries**: Government, healthcare, finance, cloud providers, and any enterprise using Citrix NetScaler.
- **Regulatory Body**: U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).

### FBI Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Security Policy – Authentication Guidance
- **Description**: New FBI guidance re-emphasizes best practices for passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and granular access control to maintain CJIS compliance when handling criminal-justice data.
- **Impact**: Organizations processing or storing CJIS-regulated information must ensure password complexity, enable MFA for all privileged and remote access, and document role-based access controls.
- **Timeline**: Guidance is effective immediately as an interpretation of standing CJIS Security Policy.
- **Affected Industries**: State & local law-enforcement agencies, justice information service providers, cloud/SaaS vendors servicing those agencies.
- **Regulatory Body**: Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CJIS Division.

### UK National Crime Agency (NCA) – Cyber-crime Enforcement Actions
- **Description**: The NCA arrested four individuals linked to large-scale (£440 million) cyberattacks on major UK retailers and alleged members of the “Scattered Spider” ransomware group.
- **Impact**: Demonstrates active enforcement of UK Computer Misuse statutes; highlights legal exposure for executives who fail to institute adequate cyber-controls that could be construed as facilitating criminal activity.
- **Timeline**: Arrests announced this week; prosecutions pending.
- **Affected Industries**: Retail, airlines, and any organization previously targeted by the group.
- **Regulatory Body**: UK National Crime Agency (NCA).

## Compliance Requirements and Obligations

- **CJIS MFA & Password Hygiene**
  - **Framework/Standard**: FBI CJIS Security Policy
  - **Implementation Details**: Enforce MFA on all CJIS-connected systems; minimum 20-character passwords or equivalent pass-phrase; quarterly credential audits.

- **Citrix NetScaler Patch Mandate**
  - **Framework/Standard**: CISA KEV Catalog (federal directive)
  - **Implementation Details**: Apply Citrix-issued firmware updates; validate no vulnerable versions remain; document remediation in vulnerability-management system.

- **AI Governance for SaaS Integrations**
  - **Framework/Standard**: Internal AI usage policies aligned to emerging best practices (no specific regulation cited)
  - **Implementation Details**: Establish data-governance review boards; implement model-input logging, privacy impact assessments, and vendor-risk questionnaires for AI features.

- **Passkey Adoption for Passwordless Authentication**
  - **Framework/Standard**: FIDO-based passkey model (standard referenced conceptually)
  - **Implementation Details**: Update IAM roadmaps; pilot passkeys for workforce SSO; revise user education and fallback-recovery procedures.

## Risk Management Developments

- **Critical Infrastructure Vulnerabilities**
  - Citrix NetScaler (CVE-2025-5777), ServiceNow (CVE-2025-3648), mcp-remote RCE, eSIM Oracle bug, PerfektBlue Bluetooth stack, AMD Transient Scheduler attacks.
  - **Assessment Methods**: Continuous vulnerability scanning, SBOM reviews, threat-intelligence subscription to KEV and vendor advisories.
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Priority patching, compensating network controls (WAF, segmentation), temporary service disabling where patches unavailable.

- **Supply-Chain & Third-Party Risk**
  - Ingram Micro ransomware, Trojanized Termius app, fake gaming/AI companies distributing malware.
  - **Assessment Methods**: Third-party risk questionnaires, contractual security clauses, real-time threat-feed correlation to supplier IPs.
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Zero-trust access segmentation, mandatory incident-notification SLAs, continuous monitoring of supplier security posture.

- **Data Breach & Exfiltration**
  - Nippon Steel, Qantas 5.7 million records exposed.
  - **Assessment Methods**: DLP telemetry, dark-web monitoring for leaked datasets, breach-impact modeling.
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Rapid containment playbooks, mandatory regulatory notification workflows, enhanced encryption and tokenization.

- **Identity & Authentication Risk**
  - SIM-swap fraud uptick, Microsoft Authenticator iCloud backup shift, passkey rollout complexity.
  - **Assessment Methods**: MFA effectiveness review, SIM-port-out monitoring, credential-stuffing detection.
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Number-porting PINs, hardware keys for admins, backup-encryption validation.

## Governance and Oversight Changes

- **AI Oversight**
  - **Requirements**: Establish AI Ethics/Governance committee; document data-usage policies for SaaS-embedded generative AI; mandate executive review of high-risk use cases.
  - **Accountability**: CIO/CTO in partnership with Chief Risk & Compliance Officers.

- **Board-Level Cyber-Risk Reporting**
  - Triggered by high-profile breaches (Qantas, Nippon Steel) and law-enforcement takedowns; boards expected to demand quarterly vulnerability-exposure reports and incident-readiness metrics.
  - **Accountability**: CISO to Audit/Risk committees.

- **Incident-Response Policy Updates**
  - Lessons from ransomware at Ingram Micro and Citrix KEV exploitation.
  - **Requirements**: 24-hour executive notification, cross-functional crisis-management team activation, post-incident root-cause analysis presented to governance committees.
  - **Accountability**: CISO, General Counsel, Communications.

## Industry-Specific Impacts

- **Government & Public Sector**
  - Must patch Citrix NetScaler (KEV) and uphold CJIS MFA requirements; increased reporting obligations to CISA.

- **Retail**
  - Heightened monitoring after NCA arrests; reinforce PCI-DSS controls and incident-notification readiness.

- **Aviation**
  - Qantas breach emphasizes need for passenger-data encryption and alignment with Australia’s Privacy Act breach-notification rules.

- **Automotive**
  - PerfektBlue Bluetooth flaws require OEM firmware updates and post-production patch delivery to Mercedes, Volkswagen, and Skoda vehicles.

- **Telecommunications & Mobile OEMs**
  - eSIM vulnerability mandates SIM applet updates and carrier coordination to prevent spying or device takeover.

- **Technology & SaaS Providers**
  - ServiceNow ACL flaw and AI governance trends necessitate tighter SDLC controls, secure-by-design principles, and transparent customer communication on AI features.

- **Semiconductor & Hardware Manufacturers**
