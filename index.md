# GRC Intelligence Report

Recent security disclosures and enforcement actions underscore a rapidly shifting GRC landscape. Key developments include (1) a record €2.95 billion antitrust penalty against Google that reinforces EU competition compliance expectations, (2) Microsoft’s tenant-wide enforcement of multifactor authentication for every Azure Portal sign-in, (3) a critical CVE-2025-42957 exploit actively targeting SAP S/4HANA systems that demands immediate patching, and (4) a series of supply-chain and phishing attacks—ranging from “s1ngularity” malware on GitHub to SVG-based social-engineering lures—highlighting escalating third-party and cloud-ecosystem risks. Meanwhile, emerging IoT security statutes, FTC scrutiny of email-filtering practices, and increasing board-level accountability for AI “toxic flows” signal growing governance obligations across sectors.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

### European Commission – Antitrust Fine on Google
- **Description**: The Commission fined Google €2.95 billion ($3.5 billion) for abusing dominance in the digital ad-tech market by favoring its own services.  
- **Impact**: Organizations operating ad-tech platforms must review pricing, self-preferencing, and data-sharing practices to ensure competitive neutrality.  
- **Timeline**: Fine is effective immediately; Google must comply with behavioral remedies once formal decision is published.  
- **Affected Industries**: Digital advertising, online publishing, marketing platforms, cloud service providers.  
- **Regulatory Body**: European Commission (Directorate-General for Competition).

### Microsoft – Mandatory MFA for Azure Portal
- **Description**: Microsoft has enforced multifactor authentication (MFA) for all Azure Portal sign-ins across every tenant since March 2025.  
- **Impact**: Tenants must ensure MFA is enabled for every user, update access policies, and verify compatible authentication methods.  
- **Timeline**: Enforcement began March 2025 and is ongoing.  
- **Affected Industries**: All sectors using Microsoft Azure.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Corporate policy (Microsoft); maps to global data-protection and cloud-security best practices.

### U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) – Oversight of Email Filtering
- **Description**: FTC chair sent a letter to Google’s CEO requesting justification for Gmail spam-filtering practices, citing potential political bias.  
- **Impact**: Email-service providers should document filtering algorithms, maintain impartiality controls, and prepare transparency reports.  
- **Timeline**: Letter issued last week; Google response deadline not publicly stated.  
- **Affected Industries**: Email and messaging platforms, political campaign services.  
- **Regulatory Body**: U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

### Emerging IoT Security Legislation
- **Description**: Experts note “new laws and applied best practices” improving IoT security over the past five years.  
- **Impact**: Manufacturers and operators must integrate secure-by-design principles, maintain firmware-update capabilities, and provide device transparency.  
- **Timeline**: Ongoing; specific statutory dates not cited.  
- **Affected Industries**: Consumer electronics, industrial control systems, healthcare devices.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Varies by jurisdiction (article does not name specific statutes).

## Compliance Requirements and Obligations

- **Mandatory Azure MFA**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: Aligns with ISO 27001 “Access Control” and NIST SP 800-63 recommendations.  
  - **Implementation Details**: Enforce MFA for all portal logins; update conditional-access policies and user provisioning workflows.

- **CVE-2025-42957 Patch Management**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: NIST CSF “Protect” & “Detect”; CIS Control 7 (Vulnerability Management).  
  - **Implementation Details**: Apply SAP’s released patch, verify system integrity, and conduct post-patch penetration testing.

- **Ad-Tech Competitive Neutrality**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: EU Competition Law compliance programs.  
  - **Implementation Details**: Perform antitrust risk assessments, segregate commercially sensitive data, and train ad-sales teams.

- **Email-Filtering Transparency**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: FTC unfair-practices guidelines.  
  - **Implementation Details**: Document spam-filter logic, publish transparency metrics, and provide opt-out mechanisms.

- **IoT Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: ETSI EN 303 645 best practices.  
  - **Implementation Details**: Embed threat modeling in product design, mandate unique credentials, and ensure over-the-air update processes.

## Risk Management Developments

- **Supply-Chain Risk (Software Repositories)**  
  - **Assessment Methods**: SBOM analysis, token-scanning, and dependency-tracking tools.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Enforce signed packages, rotate compromised secrets, and implement repository-access least privilege.

- **Phishing & Social-Engineering (SVG-Based Lures)**  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Secure email gateways, sandbox analysis of attachments, user-report metrics.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Block risky MIME types, train staff on visual spoofs, and deploy DMARC/DKIM.

- **Critical Infrastructure Threats (Energy Sector)**  
  - **Assessment Methods**: MITRE ATT&CK for ICS mapping, sector-specific threat intelligence.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Network segmentation, real-time anomaly detection, incident-response tabletop exercises.

- **Malware-as-a-Service (TAG-150 / CastleRAT)**  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Dark-web monitoring, endpoint behavior analytics.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Endpoint detection & response (EDR), takedown coordination with ISPs, and vendor-risk reviews.

- **AI “Toxic Flow” Vulnerabilities**  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Boundary analysis between AI agents and core systems, red-teaming.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Input/output validation, human-in-the-loop approvals, and AI governance policies.
