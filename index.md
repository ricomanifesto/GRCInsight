# GRC Intelligence Report

Over the past week, the most material GRC developments centre on escalating cyber-threat activity, emerging regulatory scrutiny of large technology vendors, and widening patch-management gaps that increase systemic risk across critical industries. Ransomware actors are weaponising signed kernel drivers (ThrottleStop.sys) and unpatched network appliances (CVE-2024-40766) to bypass controls, while proof-of-concept exploits for Apple CarPlay highlight persistent security-by-design failures in the automotive supply chain. A U.S. Senator has formally requested an FTC investigation into Microsoft’s security practices after high-profile cloud intrusions, underscoring rising governance pressure on software providers. The EU’s continuing sanctions regime against “bulletproof” hosting companies and the disclosure of a breach at Panama’s Ministry of Economy illustrate intensifying global enforcement trends. Organisations should reassess third-party risk, patch-management hygiene, and board-level oversight to maintain compliance and resilience.
