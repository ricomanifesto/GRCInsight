# GRC Intelligence Report

Over the past week the threat landscape has been dominated by critical software vulnerabilities, high-profile data breaches, new ransomware incentives, and urgent government-issued patch directives.  The U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) fast-tracked a critical Citrix NetScaler flaw (CVE-2025-5777) into its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog and ordered federal agencies to remediate within 24 hours, underscoring regulators’ increasing use of rapid-response mandates.  Simultaneously, vendors including Fortinet, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and OpenSynergy released security guidance and patches for remote-code-execution vulnerabilities that threaten millions of systems ranging from data-center appliances to automobiles.  Supply-chain security weaknesses surfaced again through a backdoored Gravity Forms plug-in and a zero-day in the OpenVSX extension marketplace.  Meanwhile, the Pay2Key ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation raised affiliate payouts to 80 percent, signaling heightened ransomware risk for U.S. and Israeli organizations.  Declining cyber-insurance premiums, large-scale breaches at McDonald’s and Nippon Steel, and arrests tied to the Scattered Spider gang further illustrate the evolving intersection of governance, risk management, and regulatory enforcement.
