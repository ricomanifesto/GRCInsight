# GRC Intelligence Report

Recent weeks saw a significant uptick in regulatory scrutiny, mandatory security actions, and evolving risk landscapes. Key developments include the European Commission’s €2.95 billion fine against Google for digital-advertising market abuse, the U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) emergency directive compelling federal agencies to patch an actively exploited Sitecore flaw by 25 September 2025, and Microsoft’s global enforcement of multifactor authentication (MFA) for all Azure Portal tenants. At the same time, multiple critical vulnerabilities (SAP S/4HANA – CVE-2025-42957, Argo CD API credential leak, malicious npm packages) and new threat-actor activity (TAG-150’s CastleRAT, Grok-based spam campaigns) highlight persistent supply-chain and cloud-service risks. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has also queried Google on alleged partisan bias in Gmail spam filtering, signalling rising governance expectations around algorithmic transparency. Collectively, organisations must strengthen software-supply-chain controls, accelerate patch management, adopt MFA-by-default, and prepare for more assertive regulatory oversight of cybersecurity, privacy, and competition practices.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

### European Commission Fine on Google for AdTech Market Abuse
- **Description**: The European Commission imposed a €2.95 billion ($3.5 billion) penalty on Google for abusing dominance in digital advertising and self-preferencing its own ad-tech services.

- **Impact**: Agencies must update Sitecore instances, verify remediation, and report status to CISA.  
- **Timeline**: Patch and reporting deadline – 25 September 2025.  
- **Affected Industries**: U.S. federal agencies; any commercial entities using Sitecore are strongly advised to follow suit.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), U.S. DHS.

### FTC Letter to Google on Gmail Spam Filtering Practices
- **Description**: FTC Chair requested Google explain why Gmail allegedly blocks Republican campaign emails while allowing comparable Democratic emails.  
- **Impact**: Raises governance and compliance expectations for algorithmic transparency and potential fairness audits.  
- **Timeline**: Google requested to respond by a date set in the FTC letter (date not provided).  
- **Affected Industries**: Email service providers, political campaign platforms.  
- **Regulatory Body**: U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

### Microsoft Enforcement of MFA for Azure Portal
- **Description**: Since March 2025, Microsoft requires MFA for all Azure Portal sign-ins across every tenant.  
- **Impact**: Tenants must ensure all user accounts enrol in supported MFA methods; legacy authentication flows without MFA are blocked.  
- **Timeline**: Enforcement already active; ongoing.  
- **Affected Industries**: All Azure cloud customers.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Corporate policy (Microsoft); aligns with industry security baselines.

### IoT Security Legislative Landscape
- **Description**: Experts highlight “new laws and applied best practices” improving IoT security over the past five years (specific statutes not enumerated in the article).  
- **Impact**: Manufacturers must integrate security-by-design, provide patching mechanisms, and meet baseline standards emerging in multiple jurisdictions.  
- **Timeline**: Ongoing, varies by jurisdiction.  
- **Affected Industries**: Consumer and industrial IoT device manufacturers, distributors.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Multiple (regional and national regulators).

## Compliance Requirements and Obligations
