# GRC Intelligence Report

A steady cadence of high-impact cyber incidents and vulnerability disclosures dominated this period’s GRC landscape. One million Farmers Insurance customers were affected by a data breach, multiple ransomware and state-sponsored attacks disrupted private- and public-sector operations, and several critical zero-day vulnerabilities (Citrix NetScaler, Git, and a new 5G-downgrade technique) were confirmed as actively exploited. The U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) reacted by adding the Git flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, triggering mandatory, time-bound remediation for U.S. federal agencies and setting a de-facto benchmark for all sectors. At the same time, Gartner’s call for rapid AI-agent adoption spotlights the growing governance dilemma around emerging technology deployments. Collectively, these developments reinforce the urgency for boards and executive leadership to tighten oversight of third-party risk, vulnerability management, incident response, and AI governance while aligning actions with established frameworks such as NIST CSF, ISO/IEC 27001, and state data-breach notification statutes.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

### CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog – Git Arbitrary Code-Execution Flaw  
- **Description**: CISA added a newly disclosed Git vulnerability that allows arbitrary code execution to the KEV catalog, formally recognizing it as being exploited in the wild.  
- **Impact**: Federal civilian executive-branch (FCEB) agencies must identify all affected Git instances and apply vendor-recommended patches or mitigations. Private-sector organizations are strongly encouraged to mirror this timeline to maintain due-care and regulatory-equivalency postures.  
- **Timeline**: Agencies must comply within the remediation window defined by CISA’s Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01 (exact date not provided in the article).  
- **Affected Industries**: Federal government; software development; any sector using Git for source-code management.  
- **Regulatory Body**: U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).

### Citrix Security Advisory – NetScaler ADC & NetScaler Gateway (includes CVE-2025-7775)  
- **Description**: Citrix released patches for three vulnerabilities in NetScaler products, confirming active exploitation of CVE-2025-7775.  
- **Impact**: Organizations running affected NetScaler versions must patch immediately, review appliance-access logs for indicators of compromise (IoCs), and update change-management records to show timely remediation.  
- **Timeline**: Patches are available now; immediate application is advised.  
- **Affected Industries**: Healthcare, finance, government, and any enterprise that relies on Citrix NetScaler for application delivery or remote-access gateways.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Vendor advisory (Citrix); indirectly drives compliance under sectoral cybersecurity regulations and contractual obligations.

## Compliance Requirements and Obligations

- **Data-Breach Notification – Farmers Insurance Incident**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: State data-breach notification statutes; NAIC Insurance Data Security Model Law (where adopted).  
  - **Implementation Details**: Notify impacted customers and regulators, provide credit-monitoring services, and file mandated regulatory reports within statutory timelines.

- **Ransomware Incident Response – Data I/O & Nevada State Offices**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: NIST SP 800-61 (Computer Security Incident Handling Guide).  
  - **Implementation Details**: Activate incident-response plans, isolate affected systems, engage law enforcement as required, and perform root-cause analysis for lessons-learned reporting.

- **KEV Patch Compliance – Git Vulnerability**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: U.S. BOD 22-01; NIST CSF “Protect” & “Respond” functions.  
  - **Implementation Details**: Inventory all Git assets, apply patches, document completion, and submit compliance confirmation where applicable.

- **Zero-Day Mitigation – Citrix NetScaler**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A 8.29 (Information Security in Development & Support Processes).  
  - **Implementation Details**: Expedite emergency-change process, apply vendor patches, conduct post-patch validation, and update risk register.

- **OAuth Token Security – Salesloft/Salesforce Breach**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: SOC 2 “Security” & “Confidentiality” principles; NIST SP 800-63 (Digital Identity).  
  - **Implementation Details**: Revoke compromised tokens, enforce MFA for API access, and implement least-privilege scopes for third-party integrations.

## Risk Management Developments

- **Risk Area**: Zero-Day & Actively Exploited Vulnerabilities (Citrix, Git)  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Continuous vulnerability scanning, threat-intelligence correlation, and CVSS scoring.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Implement rapid patching SLAs, maintain virtual-patching via WAF or IPS where immediate fixes are impractical, and conduct compromise-assessment hunts.

- **Risk Area**: Third-Party & Supply-Chain Threats (Salesloft OAuth, Farmers Insurance vendor environment)  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Third-party risk questionnaires, SSAE-18 SOC report reviews, API-security assessments.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Enforce contractual security clauses, monitor vendor access, and adopt continuous third-party risk-scoring tools.

- **Risk Area**: Ransomware & Extortion (Data I/O, Hook Android Trojan)  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Ransomware readiness assessments, tabletop exercises, backup-restore testing.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Network segmentation, immutable backups, endpoint detection & response (EDR), and user-awareness training focusing on mobile malware.

- **Risk Area**: Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) Exposure  
  - **Assessment Methods**: External-attack-surface mapping, port-scan analytics, baseline traffic monitoring.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Disable unnecessary RDP, enforce MFA, and deploy just-in-time access solutions.

- **Risk Area**: 5G Network Integrity (Sni5Gect attack)  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Pen-testing of 5G infrastructure, protocol-fuzzing.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Firmware updates for mobile devices, telecom-grade intrusion detection, and network-slice segmentation.

## Governance and Oversight Changes

- **Board Cyber-Oversight Enhancement**
