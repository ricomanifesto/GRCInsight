# GRC Intelligence Report

A surge of sophisticated cyber-attacks, supply-chain compromises, and privacy-driven product changes dominate this cycle’s GRC landscape. Key developments include a U.S. federal indictment linking the Chinese “Silk Typhoon” threat group to state-aligned contractors, a wave of data-theft attacks perpetrated through mis-configured Salesforce instances by “ShinyHunters,” and ransomware threats against global distributor Ingram Micro.  Meanwhile, regulators and platforms are tightening controls: YouTube is deploying AI-based age verification, Apple has rushed security patches for an actively-exploited vulnerability, and South Korean authorities are warning citizens about more than 250 fake mobile apps used for extortion.  High-profile exploits (WordPress “Alone” theme, fake PyPI site, 4G Raspberry Pi inside a bank network) underscore the urgency of enhanced third-party and application-security governance.  Organizations must accelerate patch management, expand supply-chain due-diligence, and strengthen incident-response playbooks to remain compliant with data-protection and consumer-safety obligations.

  - **Framework/Standard**: Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF), SOC 2, ISO 27034.  
  - **Implementation Details**: Enforce multi-factor authentication on developer accounts, validate package sources to avoid fake PyPI sites, and integrate SBOM checks into CI/CD pipelines.

- **Third-Party Data-Processing Due Diligence**
  - **Framework/Standard**: GDPR, CCPA, PCI DSS 4.0 (where applicable).  
  - **Implementation Details**: Re-assess contracts with cloud CRMs (e.g., Salesforce) to confirm security controls and breach-notification clauses in light of ShinyHunters attacks.

- **Age-Gated Content Controls**
  - **Framework/Standard**: COPPA, UK Online Safety Act, EU Digital Services Act.  
  - **Implementation Details**: Adopt YouTube’s new age-verification APIs and ensure marketing teams maintain compliant audience filters.

- **Ransomware Incident Preparedness**
  - **Framework/Standard**: NIST SP 800-61 (IR), CIS Controls v8 (IG3).  
  - **Implementation Details**: Maintain offline backups, test restoration, and integrate publicly-released decryptors (e.g., FunkSec) into playbooks.

## Risk Management Developments

- **Risk Area**: Ransomware & Data Extortion
  - **Assessment Methods**: Table-top exercises simulating SafePay threats; ransomware readiness assessments.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Network segmentation, immutable backups, and validated incident-response runbooks.

- **Risk Area**: Supply-Chain/Development Platforms
  - **Assessment Methods**: SBOM generation, dependency scanning, phishing-resilience testing for developer credentials.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Enforce MFA, code-signing, provenance checks for external libraries (e.g., PyPI).

- **Risk Area**: Web Application & CMS Vulnerabilities
  - **Assessment Methods**: Continuous attack-surface monitoring, penetration tests focused on themes/plugins (WordPress “Alone” RCE).  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Auto-update critical plugins, WAF rules, least-privilege file-upload permissions.

- **Risk Area**: Insider & Physical Intrusion
  - **Assessment Methods**: Physical-security audits, rogue-device scans (4G Raspberry Pi in bank).  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: NAC solutions, asset tracking, surveillance, and secure cabling.

- **Risk Area**: Social-Engineering & Voice Phishing
  - **Assessment Methods**: Simulated vishing campaigns mirroring ShinyHunters tactics.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Employee awareness training, caller-ID spoofing detection, transaction verification callbacks.

- **Risk Area**: Fraudulent Online Platforms
  - **Assessment Methods**: Brand-monitoring services, dark-web reconnaissance (fake gaming & crypto apps).
