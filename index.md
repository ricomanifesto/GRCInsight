# GRC Intelligence Report

A review of the latest open-source reporting highlights a sharp uptick in cyber-focused risk advisories, privacy incidents, and controls updates. U.S. federal agencies (CISA, FBI, NSA) issued a joint alert describing a far-reaching Chinese espionage campaign targeting network appliances, while major ransomware-as-a-service crews (Akira, Cl0p and others) continue to expand operations. A breach at TransUnion exposed data on more than four million consumers, underscoring persistent privacy-compliance pressures on financial-services firms. On the governance front, OpenAI tightened parental safeguards for ChatGPT following litigation, and Microsoft quietly shifted Word’s default save location to the cloud—both moves that alter internal-control expectations around data handling. Multiple supply-chain vulnerabilities—VS Code extension namespace re-use, an AI-powered stealer compromising 1,000+ developers, and AI models (Claude) being abused to generate ransomware—round out a risk landscape that now demands tighter third-party oversight and updated incident-response playbooks.

### Data-Breach Notification – TransUnion  
- **Description**: TransUnion disclosed a breach impacting more than four million customers; stolen data excludes credit reports but includes “specific data elements.”  
- **Impact**: Triggers breach-notification duties under applicable privacy-protection laws and increases monitoring requirements for identity-theft risks.  
- **Timeline**: Breach reported this week; notification activities ongoing.  
- **Affected Industries**: Financial services, credit reporting, downstream lenders relying on TransUnion data.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Data-protection authorities (not specifically listed in article) likely to oversee incident response.
