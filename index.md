# GRC Intelligence Report

A series of recently disclosed cyber-security incidents and advisories underscore persistent weaknesses in multi-factor authentication, open-source software supply chains, and zero-day vulnerability management. Notable developments include a phishing campaign (“PoisonSeed”) that downgrades FIDO2 security keys, active exploitation of CVE-2025-54309 in CrushFTP, hijacking of two highly-used npm linter packages, and the removal of malicious Arch Linux AUR packages delivering Chaos RAT. The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) also formally attributed “Authentic Antics” Microsoft 365 credential-stealing malware to Russia’s GRU (APT28) and issued corresponding guidance. In parallel, multiple AI announcements (e.g., forthcoming GPT-5, new educational AI tools, and advanced voice-cloning utilities) raise fresh governance and privacy concerns that boards should address through updated oversight mechanisms. Collectively, these events demand immediate attention to MFA configuration, software-supply-chain controls, patch management, incident response readiness, and responsible AI governance.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

### UK NCSC Advisory – Attribution of “Authentic Antics” Malware to APT28 (GRU)
- **Description**: The UK NCSC formally linked the “Authentic Antics” Microsoft 365 credential-stealing campaign to APT28, Russia’s military intelligence service. The advisory details TTPs and recommends mitigations.  
- **Impact**: UK-based and international organizations using Microsoft 365 must review identity logs, block malicious IPs, implement conditional access, and update incident-response playbooks.  
- **Timeline**: Advisory effective immediately; no sunset date provided.  
- **Affected Industries**: Government, defense contractors, critical infrastructure, and any enterprise relying on Microsoft 365.  
- **Regulatory Body**: UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).  

### CrushFTP Security Bulletin – CVE-2025-54309 Zero-Day

- **Regulatory Body**: Vendor-issued bulletin (CrushFTP); treated as de facto compliance requirement where file-transfer security is regulated.

### Microsoft Windows Notice – Firewall Error-Log Bug (Unresolved)
- **Description**: Microsoft erroneously tagged an ongoing Windows Firewall error-message bug as fixed. The issue remains unresolved, and Microsoft is still investigating.  
- **Impact**: Administrators must not assume remediation is in place; continue monitoring for firewall anomalies and apply future updates when released.  
- **Timeline**: Resolution date pending.
