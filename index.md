# GRC Intelligence Report  

The recent collection of cybersecurity articles underscores a sharp increase in exploitation of unpatched software, identity-based attacks, and sophisticated social-engineering fraud. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) expanded its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, effectively creating new mandatory patch obligations for U.S. federal agencies while signalling best-practice deadlines for the private sector. Multiple large-scale breach disclosures (Ingram Micro, Qantas) and enforcement actions (arrest tied to Silk Typhoon) highlight growing regulatory and law-enforcement scrutiny worldwide. At the same time, leading payment processor PayPal rolled out AI-driven fraud-interdiction that raises the compliance bar for real-time transaction monitoring. Across industries—retail, manufacturing, finance, aviation, government, and critical infrastructure—boards and risk leaders must reinforce identity-and-access controls, third-party software governance, and incident-response playbooks to meet evolving compliance expectations and reduce operational risk.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes  

### CISA – Expansion of the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog  
- **Description**: CISA added four actively exploited CVEs to its KEV catalog, formally designating them as requiring prompt remediation. The catalog addition invokes CISA’s Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01 for U.S. federal civilian agencies.  
- **Impact**:  
  • Federal agencies must inventory affected assets and apply vendor-approved patches or mitigations.  
  • Private-sector entities are strongly encouraged to adopt the same timelines to satisfy due-care expectations under most cyber-regulatory frameworks and cyber-insurance contracts.  
- **Timeline**: Article states specific remediation deadlines for federal agencies (e.g., patch by “July 29 2025” for the newly listed flaws).  
- **Affected Industries**: Federal agencies, critical infrastructure operators, technology vendors, and any enterprise using vulnerable products.  
- **Regulatory Body**: U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).  

### International Law-Enforcement Action – Arrest Linked to “Silk Typhoon”  
- **Description**: A Chinese national was arrested in Milan for alleged participation in state-sponsored cyber-espionage against U.S. organizations.  
- **Impact**: Demonstrates increasing cross-border cooperation on cyber-crime, reinforcing obligations to preserve forensic evidence and support lawful investigations under treaties such as the Budapest Convention.  
- **Timeline**: Arrest executed the week prior to article publication; extradition hearing pending.  
- **Affected Industries**: Defense, technology, and any entity targeted by Silk Typhoon.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Italian State Police in cooperation with U.S. federal authorities.  

### PayPal – AI-Driven Real-Time Scam Interdiction  
- **Description**: PayPal introduced an AI model that can automatically pause or cancel suspicious peer-to-peer transactions before funds are transferred.  
- **Impact**:  
  • Sets a new industry benchmark for “real-time fraud monitoring” often referenced in global electronic-payments regulations.  
  • Merchants and payment processors partnering with PayPal must ensure their own fraud-screening controls integrate with, and do not bypass, the new system.  
- **Timeline**: Feature is rolling out “now,” according to PayPal, with gradual account coverage expansion.  
- **Affected Industries**: FinTech, e-commerce, and any organization accepting PayPal payments.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Not a government mandate but maps to compliance expectations under PCI-DSS, EU PSD2, and similar regimes.

## Compliance Requirements and Obligations  

- **KEV Patch Compliance**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: CISA BOD 22-01; NIST CSF PR.IP-12 (vulnerability management)  
  - **Implementation Details**: Identify susceptible assets, apply vendor patches by listed KEV deadlines, document evidence for auditors.  

- **Identity-Access Hardening for Retail Environments**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: PCI-DSS v4.0, ISO 27001 Annex A 5  
  - **Implementation Details**: Enforce least-privilege roles, rotate vendor API tokens, implement MFA for admin accounts, and monitor dormant credentials.  

- **Third-Party IoT Device Security (TBK DVRs & Four-Faith Routers)**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: IEC 62443, NIST IoT SP 800-213  
  - **Implementation Details**: Change default passwords, disable unused services, apply firmware updates, and continuously scan for exposed management ports.  

- **Incident Disclosure and Ransomware Notification**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: Australian Privacy Act Notifiable Data Breaches (for Qantas); SEC cyber-incident disclosure rules (for Ingram Micro, if listed in U.S.)  
  - **Implementation Details**: Assess breach scope within 30 days, notify regulators and affected individuals, publish Form 8-K/ASX announcement as required.  

- **Real-Time Fraud Monitoring Controls**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: PCI-DSS 10.8, EU PSD2 Article 97 (if operating in EU)  
  - **Implementation Details**: Integrate AI-based transaction-scoring, establish manual review queues, and maintain model-risk-management documentation.
