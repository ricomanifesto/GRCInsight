# GRC Intelligence Report

A series of security disclosures, enforcement actions, and technology announcements over the last week highlight a tightening global focus on cyber-resilience, data-privacy enforcement, and critical-infrastructure protection. Government agencies such as the Netherlands NCSC issued urgent vulnerability warnings, while a $177 million AT&T data-breach settlement underlined the growing financial consequences of privacy failures. Concurrently, multiple reports exposed serious encryption weaknesses in industrial and law-enforcement communication protocols (TETRA and OPC UA), and several zero-day exploits (Citrix NetScaler CVE-2025-6543 and WinRAR CVE-2025-8088) were confirmed as actively weaponised by state-aligned threat actors. Emerging AI-governance concerns also surfaced, with researchers demonstrating a full GPT-5 “jailbreak” within 24 hours of launch and OpenAI experimenting with new usage limits to manage model misuse risks. Collectively, these developments demand immediate attention to patch management, supply-chain risk assessment, incident-response readiness, and board-level oversight of rapidly evolving AI and operational-technology threats.

### Law-Enforcement Communications Alert on TETRA Encryption Flaws
- **Description**: Researchers disclosed new weaknesses in the Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) protocol, including its proprietary end-to-end encryption.  
- **Impact**: Agencies using TETRA must review key-management practices, disable vulnerable cipher suites, and accelerate migration to stronger cryptographic options.  
- **Timeline**: Vulnerabilities publicly disclosed; remediation guidance expected from national public-safety regulators.  
- **Affected Industries**: Law enforcement, emergency services, critical infrastructure using TETRA radios.  
- **Regulatory Body**: No single regulator named; guidance expected from national public-safety and spectrum authorities.
