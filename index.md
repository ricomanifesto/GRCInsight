# GRC Intelligence Report

In the latest review period, threat-driven developments dominated the GRC landscape.  A surge of sophisticated cyber-attacks (state-sponsored espionage, supply-chain phishing, ransomware, mobile spyware, and critical WordPress exploits) is reshaping risk appetites and forcing organizations to re-evaluate controls around third-party SaaS, software repositories, and consumer-facing apps.  Enforcement actions—including a newly unsealed U.S. federal indictment against the “Silk Typhoon” Chinese threat group—and platform policy changes such as YouTube’s AI-based age-verification engine illustrate regulators’ and providers’ heightened focus on accountability and user protection.  Meanwhile, major technology vendors (Apple, Google, WordPress ecosystem maintainers) have issued urgent security patches or new security features (e.g., Chrome passkey sync) that translate directly into updated compliance obligations for patch management, identity assurance, and privacy governance.  Ransomware remains the most disruptive operational threat, with SafePay threatening to leak 3.5 TB of Ingram Micro data, while the release of a free decryptor for FunkSec highlights the value of coordinated response and information-sharing.  Collectively, these events underscore the continued convergence of governance vigilance, proactive risk management, and rigorous compliance execution.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

### U.S. DOJ Indictment of “Silk Typhoon” (Chinese Nation-State Threat Group)
