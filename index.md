# GRC Intelligence Report

Over the last week, the GRC landscape has been dominated by national-security sanctions, escalating supply-chain and espionage attacks, and fresh guidance on travel and behavioral security.  The U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued new sanctions against a North-Korean front company running fraudulent remote-IT schemes, immediately expanding global screening obligations.  Policy-wise, the newly-released “AI Action Plan” signals a deregulatory stance that nonetheless encourages open-source AI development, creating governance considerations for boards and CISOs.  Meanwhile, multiple threat-intelligence reports – including the compromise of Amazon’s Q Developer Extension, “Fire Ant” intrusions into siloed VMware environments, an AI-generated Linux miner (“Koske”), and sector-specific spear-phishing (Patchwork, EAGLET) – underscore the growing risks to software supply chains and virtual infrastructures.  Outages in Microsoft 365 and TSA’s public advisory on airport Wi-Fi/charging ports add operational-resilience and travel-security dimensions.  Organisations should tighten sanctions screening, refresh vendor-code integrity controls, harden virtual environments, re-validate remote-worker vetting, and update employee-travel guidelines.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

### OFAC Sanctions on North-Korean Front Company and Individuals
- **Description**: OFAC sanctioned a North Korean front company and three individuals for orchestrating large-scale fraudulent remote-IT work schemes that funnel revenue to the DPRK.
- **Impact**:  
  • Organisations must immediately screen vendors, contractors, and payment flows against the updated Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list.  
  • Any existing contracts or financial ties must be frozen or terminated; relevant suspicious-activity reporting is required.  
  • Heightened due-diligence is expected during hiring or outsourcing of remote developers.
- **Timeline**: Sanctions are effective upon publication (date provided in article release).
- **Affected Industries**: All sectors hiring remote IT talent; financial services processing related payments; staffing and outsourcing platforms.
- **Regulatory Body**: U.S. Department of the Treasury – Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).

### TSA Guidance on Airport Wi-Fi and USB Charging (“Juice-Jacking”) Risks
- **Description**: The Transportation Security Administration issued travel-security advice recommending travellers avoid public USB charging ports and unsecured airport Wi-Fi networks.
- **Impact**:  
  • Enterprises should update travel policies to require use of personal power banks or AC adapters and enforce VPN usage on public networks.  
  • Security-awareness programmes should incorporate the TSA guidance into mandatory briefings for frequent travellers.
- **Timeline**: Advisory currently in force; no stated expiry.
- **Affected Industries**: Business travellers across all industries; travel & hospitality providers.
- **Regulatory Body**: Transportation Security Administration (TSA), U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

### U.S. “AI Action Plan” (Policy Proposal)
- **Description**: The administration’s plan signals minimal regulatory constraints on AI companies while explicitly encouraging the adoption and development of open-source AI technologies.
- **Impact**:  
  • Boards should reassess intellectual-property, security, and licensing controls when leveraging or releasing open-source AI models.  
  • Compliance teams must track forthcoming standards or certifications that may fill the regulatory gap.
- **Timeline**: Plan publicly released; implementation mechanisms not yet defined.
- **Affected Industries**: Technology, software, defence, and any AI-enabled sector.
- **Regulatory Body**: Executive Branch policy proposal (no specific enforcement agency named).

## Compliance Requirements and Obligations

- **Sanctions Screening Enhancement**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: OFAC SDN List Compliance  
  - **Implementation Details**: Automate daily list refresh, extend checks to subcontractors and remote-worker payrolls, and document escalation procedures.

- **Remote-Worker Identity Verification**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: KYC / Employment Eligibility (I-9 equivalents internationally)  
  - **Implementation Details**: Mandate multi-factor identity proofing, video-verified onboarding, and continuous behavioural monitoring of remote sessions.

- **Secure Software Supply-Chain Controls**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: NIST SSDF, ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A 8.28 (secure development)  
  - **Implementation Details**: Require signed extensions, perform SBOM validation for IDE plug-ins (e.g., Amazon Q Extension), and integrate automated code-integrity scanning in CI/CD.

- **Virtualization & Hypervisor Hardening**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: CIS VMware Benchmarks  
  - **Implementation Details**: Enforce network segmentation of management interfaces, monitor inter-host east-west traffic, and deploy behavioural analytics for anomalous VM activity.

- **Travel-Security Policy Updates**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: ISO 31030 Travel Risk Management  
  - **Implementation Details**: Provide corporate VPN licences, distribute portable “charge-only” cables, and include TSA guidance in pre-travel risk briefings.

- **Incident-Driven Development Governance**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: DevSecOps Best Practices  
  - **Implementation Details**: Assign cybersecurity Product Managers (PMs) authority to pause deployments post-incident, integrate real-time patch-management tools (e.g., ThreatLocker) into sprint cycles.
