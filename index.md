# GRC Intelligence Report

During the past week, cyber-security coverage has been dominated by government-led disclosure initiatives, critical vulnerability patches, and a fresh wave of supply-chain and AI-driven threats. The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) unveiled its Vulnerability Research Initiative (VRI), formalising collaboration with external researchers and signalling tighter expectations for coordinated disclosure programs across UK-based organisations. India’s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) executed an international takedown of a £390K tech-support scam, underscoring the growing reach of cross-border regulatory enforcement. Meanwhile, vendors issued urgent fixes and guidance for high-impact flaws—including Fortinet’s pre-auth SQL injection (CVE-2025-25257), NVIDIA’s GPU RowHammer mitigation, and a Bluetooth “PerfektBlue” attack that threatens a billion devices—driving new patch-management and risk-assessment requirements. AI prompt-injection weaknesses in Google Gemini and widespread supply-chain compromises (Gravity Forms, Cursor VSCode extension, leaked Laravel APP_KEYs) highlight escalating governance and third-party-risk challenges. Organisations should update vulnerability-disclosure policies, reinforce secure-coding controls, and align board-level oversight with evolving insurance, privacy, and incident-response expectations.
