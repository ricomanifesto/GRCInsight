# GRC Intelligence Report

Over the past week, the dominant Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) themes have been cyber-security incidents, supply-chain compromise, privacy-centric product roll-outs, and the continuing rise of litigation and product-safety actions as de-facto compliance drivers. The most critical developments include: (1) active exploitation of three Microsoft SharePoint zero-days leading to confirmed breaches at the U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and other public-sector entities; (2) a sophisticated phishing campaign impersonating the U.S. Department of Education’s G5 grants portal; (3) a software-supply-chain attack that weaponised the hugely popular NPM package “is” (2.8 million weekly downloads); (4) a new set of cryptomining attacks against Magento e-commerce platforms and misconfigured Docker environments; (5) the Clorox v. Cognizant negligence lawsuit spotlighting vendor-management and identity-verification controls; (6) intensified bot scraping of public websites, prompting new defensive guidance; (7) privacy-by-design advances such as Proton’s encrypted AI assistant “Lumo”; and (8) an ongoing consumer-electronics recall of Anker power banks, reinforcing product-safety obligations. Together, these events emphasise the need for rapid patch management, enhanced supply-chain vetting, stronger identity-proofing processes, privacy-preserving AI governance, and cross-functional oversight by boards and executive teams.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

### Anker Power Bank Recall
- **Description**: Multiple Anker power-bank models have been subject to recall due to safety risks outlined in recent advisories.  
- **Impact**: Organisations that issue or allow bring-your-own-device (BYOD) battery packs should identify affected models, cease use, and coordinate customer or employee returns/refunds. Asset registers must be updated and disposal handled per hazardous-materials protocols.  
- **Timeline**: Immediate cessation of use; formal recall time frame not specified in the article.  
- **Affected Industries**: Consumer electronics retailers, transportation, logistics, corporate mobility programmes.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Not specified in the source article.

### Clorox v. Cognizant Negligence Litigation
- **Description**: Clorox filed suit alleging Cognizant’s help-desk failed to verify identity before a password reset, enabling a 2023 cyber-attack that cost Clorox an estimated $380 million.  
- **Impact**: Highlights heightened legal exposure for service providers under contractual security obligations; may set precedent for “gross negligence” standards in third-party cyber incidents.  
- **Timeline**: Litigation filed July 2025 (exact court dates not specified).  
- **Affected Industries**: IT outsourcing, managed service providers (MSPs), any organisation relying on vendor identity-management processes.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Case filed in U.S. civil court (specific jurisdiction not provided).

### Department of Education (DoE) Grant-Portal Phishing Campaign
- **Description**: Attackers deployed fake replicas of the DoE’s G5 portal, exploiting workforce-reduction turmoil to harvest credentials.  
- **Impact**: Federal contractors and education-sector entities must harden domain-spoofing defenses (DMARC, SPF, DKIM) and update phishing-awareness programmes to cover fake-portal tactics.  
- **Timeline**: Campaign ongoing at time of reporting.  
- **Affected Industries**: Federal agencies, higher education, grant recipients, government contractors.  
- **Regulatory Body**: U.S. Department of Education (targeted, not issuing the update).

  - **Implementation Details**: Enforce multi-factor identity proofing before privileged actions (e.g., password resets); audit help-desk procedures; integrate identity-governance platforms.

- **Phishing-Resilience for Public Portals**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: FedRAMP Moderate/High controls RA-5 & SI-3; NIST SP 800-61 (Incident Handling).
