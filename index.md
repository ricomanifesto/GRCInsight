# GRC Intelligence Report

The past week’s cyber-security news cycle has been dominated by vendor-driven security policy changes, emergency patches for actively-exploited vulnerabilities, and the discovery of new attack techniques. The most consequential developments include Microsoft’s decision to make multi-factor authentication (MFA) mandatory for all Azure resource-management actions starting in October, several urgent security updates (WhatsApp zero-click exploit, Microsoft Windows certificate-enrollment bug, Windows 11 24H2 preview fixes), and critical vulnerability disclosures affecting Sitecore XP deployments. At the same time, threat-actors continue to innovate: campaigns distributing the “TamperedChef” infostealer through fraudulent PDF editors and the abuse of the Velociraptor forensic tool to establish command-and-control (C2) tunnels illustrate persistent risks associated with open-source software and malvertising. Collectively, these items reinforce the need for robust patch-management programmes, continuous monitoring, and strengthened identity controls across cloud and on-prem environments.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

### Microsoft Azure – Mandatory MFA for Resource Management  
- **Description**: Microsoft will require MFA for every Azure Resource Manager action to reduce the risk of unauthorised administrative access.  
- **Impact**: Tenants must ensure at least one supported MFA method (e.g., Microsoft Authenticator, FIDO2, SMS, voice) is enabled for all users who perform management operations via portal, CLI, PowerShell, REST API, or SDKs. Conditional Access policies should be reviewed to avoid lock-outs.  
- **Timeline**: Enforcement begins in October (exact date not specified).  
- **Affected Industries**: All organisations using Microsoft Azure.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Microsoft (cloud service provider policy).

### WhatsApp – Emergency Security Update for iOS and macOS  
- **Description**: WhatsApp patched a vulnerability exploited in zero-day attacks that allowed a zero-click compromise of iOS and macOS clients, linked to a recently disclosed Apple flaw.  
- **Impact**: Organisations relying on WhatsApp for business communication must update clients immediately to mitigate active exploitation risk.  
- **Timeline**: Patch released; effective immediately upon installation.  
- **Affected Industries**: Any organisation with staff using WhatsApp on Apple devices.  
- **Regulatory Body**: WhatsApp (Meta Platforms).

### Microsoft Windows – Certificate Enrollment Error Resolution  
- **Description**: Microsoft fixed an issue that generated false CertificateServicesClient (CertEnroll) error messages after the July 2025 preview and subsequent Windows 11 24H2 builds.  
- **Impact**: Administrators should deploy the fix to restore accurate certificate-enrollment logging and avoid false compliance/alarm triggers in PKI monitoring systems.  
- **Timeline**: Fix released (no date provided); apply via normal update channels.  
- **Affected Industries**: All Windows 11 24H2 adopters, especially environments that rely on automated certificate workflows.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Microsoft.

## Compliance Requirements and Obligations

- **Azure MFA Enforcement**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: Microsoft secure-by-default cloud policy  
  - **Implementation Details**: Enable MFA for all privileged and automation accounts; test Conditional Access; document changes in the identity-and-access-management (IAM) register.

- **Immediate Patch for WhatsApp Clients**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: NIST SP 800-40 patch management best practices

- **Sitecore XP 10.x Security Patches**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: CIS Benchmarks / vendor guidance  
  - **Implementation Details**: Apply Sitecore-supplied hotfixes addressing cache-poisoning and remote-code-execution vulnerabilities; conduct post-patch penetration testing.

- **Windows 11 KB5064081 Preview Update**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: Microsoft Windows servicing guidelines  
  - **Implementation Details**: Validate in a staging environment before production rollout; leverage Windows Update for Business rings for phased deployment.

- **CertificateServicesClient Fix Deployment**

## Risk Management Developments

- **Risk Area**: Malvertising & Software-Supply-Chain (TamperedChef infostealer)  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Monitor browser telemetry and DNS logs for ad-redirects to unknown PDF-editor domains; employ sandbox detonation for downloaded installers.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Enforce application-whitelisting; block high-risk ad networks; provide user awareness on fraudulent download ads.

- **Risk Area**: Abuse of Legitimate Tools for C2 (Velociraptor & VS Code)  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Behaviour-based analytics to detect unusual Velociraptor deployments or unexpected VS Code network activity.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Restrict installation of forensic/admin utilities to approved hosts; implement egress-filtering to block covert tunnels.

- **Risk Area**: CMS Vulnerabilities (Sitecore cache poisoning & RCE chain)  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Automated vulnerability scanning; log review for abnormal cache behaviour.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Apply vendor patches; enable Web Application Firewalls (WAF); segregate Sitecore roles.

- **Risk Area**: Zero-Click Exploits on Mobile Platforms (WhatsApp)  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Mobile-threat-defence (MTD) solutions; inspection of crash logs indicating exploitation patterns.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Force updates via MDM; restrict high-risk attachments; conduct regular mobile incident-response drills.

## Governance and Oversight Changes

- **Governance Area**: Cloud Identity & Access Management Oversight  
  - **Requirements**: Boards should ensure policies align with Microsoft’s upcoming mandatory MFA and receive periodic reports on MFA rollout status.  
  - **Accountability**: CISO and IAM programme manager.

- **Governance Area**: Patch-Management Steering Committee  
  - **Requirements**: Establish cross-functional committee to prioritise rapid deployment of critical vendor patches (WhatsApp, Sitecore, Windows).  
  - **Accountability**: CIO (chair), IT operations lead, Internal Audit observer.

- **Governance Area**: DevSecOps Integration (Webinar insight)  
  - **Requirements**: Adopt a unified playbook that aligns Dev, Sec, and Ops teams, emphasising early security testing and shared KPIs.  
  - **Accountability**: VP Engineering and Head of Security Engineering.
