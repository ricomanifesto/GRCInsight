# GRC Intelligence Report

The past week’s security news cycle underscores a continuing trend: threat actors are aggressively exploiting un-patched software (Fortinet FortiSIEM, Erlang-based OT platforms, Microsoft Entra ID), probing remote-access infrastructure (Fortinet SSL VPN), and abusing software-supply-chain artifacts (XZ Utils Docker images, PS1Bot malvertising).  At the same time, vendors and public agencies are taking decisive — but occasionally disruptive — actions such as Microsoft’s August removal of PowerShell 2.0 and emergency downtime at the Pennsylvania Office of the Attorney General.  Collectively, these events elevate the urgency for rapid patch management, stronger authentication governance, OT network segmentation, and proactive ransomware readiness programs.  No new statutory regulations were introduced in the cited articles, but vendor platform changes and public-sector incident disclosures introduce de-facto compliance deadlines that security and GRC teams must immediately incorporate into control frameworks and risk registers.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

### Microsoft Platform Security Baseline – Removal of PowerShell 2.0
- **Description**: Microsoft will permanently remove the legacy PowerShell 2.0 engine from Windows 11 and Windows Server beginning in August.  
- **Impact**: Organisations relying on legacy scripts must migrate to supported PowerShell versions, update hardening baselines, and validate administrative tooling.  
- **Timeline**: Removal starts August (exact date provided by Microsoft bulletin).  
- **Affected Industries**: All sectors operating Windows servers or desktops.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Microsoft (vendor platform policy).

### Public-Sector Incident Disclosure – Pennsylvania Office of the Attorney General
- **Description**: A cyber-attack forced shutdown of the Pennsylvania OAG’s email, phone, and web systems.  
- **Impact**: Triggers state-level breach-notification and continuity-of-government requirements; other public agencies must review incident-response playbooks and CJIS alignment.  
- **Timeline**: Incident announced this week; restoration date not yet stated.  
- **Affected Industries**: U.S. state & local government, justice, law-enforcement.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Office of the Pennsylvania Attorney General (self-report), subject to state oversight bodies.

## Compliance Requirements and Obligations

- **FortiSIEM Critical Patch**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: Vendor security advisory (Fortinet PSIRT)  
  - **Implementation Details**: Upgrade to the fixed versions listed by Fortinet; document patch under vulnerability-management controls (e.g., ISO 27001 A.12.6.1, CIS V8 Safeguard 7.7).

- **Fortinet SSL VPN Hardening**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: Zero-Trust Network Access / CIS Controls 14 & 15  
  - **Implementation Details**: Enforce MFA, rate-limit logins, monitor for brute-force spikes observed in recent campaigns.

- **Entra ID MFA Assurance**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: NIST SP 800-63B (AAL2/AAL3)  
  - **Implementation Details**: Disable optional downgrade paths, enforce FIDO2 hardware tokens, update conditional-access policies.

- **OT Platform CVSS-10 Patch**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: IEC 62443-3-3 (System security requirements)  
  - **Implementation Details**: Apply vendor patch immediately, isolate Erlang-based nodes from business IT, validate with vulnerability scans.

- **Supply-Chain Container Validation**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: NIST SSDF | SLSA  
  - **Implementation Details**: Scan Docker registries for images containing the deprecated XZ Utils backdoor artifacts; set admission controls to block un-signed or outdated images.

- **Legacy Component Removal (PowerShell 2.0)**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: CIS Benchmarks – Windows, ISO 27001 A.12.1.2  
  - **Implementation Details**: Update build standards, verify application compatibility, and document exception handling.

## Risk Management Developments

- **Risk Area**: Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Security & OT Platforms  
  - **Assessment Methods**: CVSS scoring, exploitability trending, asset criticality mapping.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Emergency patching windows, compensating firewall rules, network segmentation.

- **Risk Area**: Authentication Downgrade & MFA Bypass  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Red-team phishing simulations, control effectiveness testing.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Enforce strongest factor binding, disable legacy auth, monitor sign-in logs for atypical methods.

- **Risk Area**: Supply-Chain / Container Image Poisoning  
  - **Assessment Methods**: SBOM analysis, registry-scan automation, provenance checks.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Signed images only, runtime policy enforcement, continuous image-vulnerability scanning.

- **Risk Area**: Ransomware-as-a-Service Intelligence (LockBit 4.0 leak)  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Threat-intel fusion, mapping leaked TTPs to MITRE ATT&CK.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Offline immutable backups, EDR fine-tuning, tabletop exercises reflecting leaked playbooks.

- **Risk Area**: Public-Sector Service Disruption  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Business impact analysis, critical dependency mapping.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Geo-redundant hosting, incident-communication plans, regulatory reporting workflows.

## Governance and Oversight Changes

- **Patch Management Governance**  
  - **Requirements**: Boards should receive quarterly metrics on time-to-patch for “critical” (CVSS ≥ 9) vulnerabilities, with Fortinet and Erlang OT incidents as immediate benchmarks.  
  - **Accountability**: CISO and CIO jointly; audit committee oversight.

- **Identity & Access Governance**  
  - **Requirements**: Update corporate IAM charters to prohibit unsupported MFA downgrades and enforce FIDO2 for privileged roles.  
  - **Accountability**: IAM Program Owner; risk committee review.

- **Legacy Technology Retirement**  
  - **Requirements**: Establish governance gates ensuring end-of-life components (e.g., PowerShell 2.0) are removed from production before vendor deadlines.  
  - **Accountability**: Enterprise Architecture board; Internal Audit validation.

- **OT Security Oversight**  
  - **Requirements**: Separate OT security committee or expand existing cyber-risk committee charters to include ICS oversight following the CVSS-10 Erlang vulnerability.  
  - **Accountability**: VP of Operations Technology; report to board risk committee.

## Industry-Specific Impacts

- **Critical Infrastructure / OT**  
  - **Sector-Specific Requirements**: Immediate patching of the Erlang-based platform (CVSS 10) and enhanced network segmentation aligned with IEC 62443 guidance.

- **Technology & Cloud Service Providers**  
  - **Sector-Specific Requirements**: Container-image provenance controls to root out XZ Utils backdoor remnants; customer notification if affected images are hosted.

- **Financial Services**  
  - **Sector-Specific Requirements**: Reinforce MFA integrity in Entra ID to maintain regulatory expectations for strong authentication (e.g., FFIEC, PCI DSS).

- **Public Sector / Government**  
  - **Sector-Specific Requirements**: Incident-response drills modeled on the Pennsylvania OAG outage; ensure continuity-of-government services and mandatory breach-reporting timelines.

- **Healthcare**  
  - **Sector-Specific Requirements**: Evaluate Fortinet VPN and FortiSIEM patch status to avoid ePHI exposure, maintaining HIPAA Security Rule compliance.
