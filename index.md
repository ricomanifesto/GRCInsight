# GRC Intelligence Report

Over the last week the GRC landscape has been dominated by U.S. sanctions activity, large–scale data-breach notification events, and a series of cyber-security incidents that highlight supply-chain weaknesses and emerging AI-driven threats.  The U.S. Treasury added fresh sanctions against a North-Korean front company and three individuals, while the U.S. Department of Justice continued criminal enforcement against the same scheme—signalling heightened expectations for sanctions-screening and beneficial-ownership due-diligence.  Separately, Allianz Life disclosed that personal data belonging to most of its 1.4 million policy-holders was exposed, triggering breach-notification and consumer-protection obligations across multiple jurisdictions.  Critical vulnerabilities were also reported in the widely-used Post SMTP WordPress plugin (200 000 sites affected) and in Amazon’s “Q Developer Extension,” underscoring the need for robust third-party risk management and secure-development life-cycle controls.  Nation-state and AI-enabled threats continued to evolve, with “Fire Ant” espionage operations against siloed VMware environments, the AI-generated “Koske” Linux miner, and spear-phishing of Turkish defense firms by “Patchwork.”  Finally, service-availability risks were spotlighted by a Microsoft 365 Admin Center outage and by TSA security guidance for travellers, reinforcing the importance of business-continuity and user-awareness controls.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes
