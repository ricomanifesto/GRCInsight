# GRC Intelligence Report

A series of government advisories, vendor alerts, and investigative actions over the past few days highlight an elevated threat environment and a tightening regulatory climate.  Key developments include a new Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigation into the safety of AI “companion” tools marketed to children, multiple national-level cyber-emergency alerts (from CERT-FR and CISA) on actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities, and Microsoft’s notice that Windows 11 23H2 Home & Pro will lose security-update eligibility in November.  At the same time, researchers disclosed ransomware that bypasses UEFI Secure Boot, critical flaws in software-development and manufacturing platforms, and privacy concerns surrounding widely-used VPN services.  Collectively, these items demand immediate board-level attention to patch-management governance, product-safety compliance, and enterprise risk posture across IT and OT environments.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

### FTC AI Companion Safety Investigation  
- **Description**: The FTC opened investigations into seven technology firms (including OpenAI and Meta) following reports that AI companions marketed to minors produced inappropriate or harmful content.  
- **Impact**: Companies offering AI chatbots or virtual companions must demonstrate adequate safeguards for minors, enhance age-verification controls, document training-data provenance, and be prepared to furnish risk-assessments to regulators.  
- **Timeline**: Investigations are currently active; no statutory deadlines were disclosed, but civil investigative demands (CIDs) require timely responses.  
- **Affected Industries**: Generative-AI providers, social-media platforms, and EdTech vendors.  
- **Regulatory Body**: U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  

### CISA Alert on DELMIA Apriso RCE Vulnerability

- **Impact**: Asset owners must identify affected versions, apply the vendor’s patch or approved mitigation, and report intrusions under applicable incident-reporting rules.  Systems unpatched may be added to CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalogue, driving federal-agency patch obligations.  
- **Timeline**: Advisory is effective immediately; CISA commonly sets a 21-day remediation window after KEV inclusion (exact date not provided in article).  
- **Affected Industries**: Manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, and other industrial sectors using DELMIA Apriso.  
- **Regulatory Body**: U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).  

### Microsoft End-of-Support Notice for Windows 11 23H2 Home & Pro  
- **Description**: Microsoft reminded customers that the Home and Pro editions of Windows 11 23H2 will reach end of servicing in 60 days, after which no security updates will be issued.  
- **Impact**: Organizations relying on these builds must upgrade to a supported release or risk non-compliance with vulnerability-management and vendor-support requirements often embedded in internal policies, contracts, and sectoral frameworks.  
- **Timeline**: End of support occurs in November (specific day not listed).  
- **Affected Industries**: All sectors operating Windows endpoints.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Microsoft (vendor lifecycle requirement; indirectly referenced by regulators through “supported software” mandates).  

### CERT-FR Advisory on Apple Zero-Day Spyware Campaign  
- **Description**: France’s national CSIRT (CERT-FR) issued an alert after Apple disclosed a zero-day flaw exploited in sophisticated spyware attacks against targeted individuals.  Apple simultaneously sent device-compromise notifications to users in France.  
- **Impact**: French public-sector entities, critical-infrastructure operators, and private companies handling sensitive data must update affected Apple devices and audit for indicators of compromise, aligning with French cybersecurity directives.  
- **Timeline**: Advisory issued in September; Apple patches already available.  
- **Affected Industries**: Government, defense contractors, journalists, and any organization with at-risk Apple devices.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Computer Emergency Response Team – France (CERT-FR).  

### USDOT Warning on Undocumented Radios in Solar-Powered Highway Devices  
- **Description**: The U.S. Department of Transportation reportedly cautioned states that certain solar-powered highway infrastructure devices contain undocumented radio transceivers, raising potential remote-access risks.  
- **Impact**: Transportation agencies must inventory deployments, disable or physically secure undocumented radios, and update procurement specifications to incorporate supply-chain security requirements.  
- **Timeline**: Advisory issued; no hard deadline stated.  
- **Affected Industries**: Transportation and critical-infrastructure operators.  
- **Regulatory Body**: U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT).
