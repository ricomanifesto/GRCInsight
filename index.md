# GRC Intelligence Report

Recent reporting highlights a surge in software-supply-chain compromises, zero-day exploitation, and novel multifactor-authentication (MFA) bypass techniques, together with official security advisories issued by national and vendor authorities. Key developments include an emergency patch requirement for the actively-exploited CrushFTP vulnerability (CVE-2025-54309), the UK NCSC’s formal attribution of “Authentic Antics” Microsoft 365 credential-stealing malware to Russia’s GRU, the takedown of malicious npm and Arch Linux AUR packages, and a phishing technique (“PoisonSeed”) that downgrades FIDO2 protections via WebAuthn’s cross-device sign-in flow. Organizations must rapidly harden MFA implementations, reinforce software-supply-chain controls, patch vulnerable file-transfer and VPN appliances, and review log-integrity processes after Microsoft’s mis-flagged Windows Firewall bug. Emerging AI tools and unsecured MCP servers introduce additional governance and data-privacy challenges that boards should integrate into enterprise risk registers.
