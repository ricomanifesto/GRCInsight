# GRC Intelligence Report

Recent security incidents and technology developments highlight a widening gap between fast-moving innovation and the governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) disciplines needed to protect organizations. Criminal prosecutions for insider sabotage and cyber-crime show aggressive enforcement action, while a raft of disclosures – from ransomware at a major UK telecom to exploitable flaws in AI-powered browsers – reinforce the urgency of strong incident-response, insider-threat, and data-protection programs.  Standardization efforts are also advancing: ISO 15118 introduces security-relevant requirements for electric-vehicle smart-charging infrastructure, and education regulators are scrutinizing K-12 cyber-preparedness as schools struggle to meet baseline controls.  Meanwhile, emerging AI risks (prompt-injection, model-downgrade attacks, and workforce disruption) are forcing boards and risk leaders to revisit governance structures, threat-modeling practices, and compliance road-maps around artificial-intelligence use.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

### ISO 15118 – Electric-Vehicle Smart-Charging & Vehicle-to-Grid Communications
- **Description**: Establishes the technical standard governing bidirectional data exchange between electric vehicles (EVs), charging stations, and the power grid, including authentication, payment, and firmware update mechanisms.  Security researchers warn the protocol can be leveraged for denial-of-service and energy-fraud attacks if controls are misconfigured.
- **Impact**: EV manufacturers, charge-point operators, and utilities must embed secure-by-design principles, enforce certificate-based authentication, and monitor for anomalous traffic on ISO 15118 channels.
- **Timeline**: Already ratified and rolling out with new smart-charging deployments.
- **Affected Industries**: Automotive, energy & utilities, public charging-network operators, smart-city integrators.
- **Regulatory Body**: International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

### U.S. Federal Criminal Enforcement – Insider Sabotage & Cyber-Crime
- **Description**: Two high-profile sentences: a 55-year-old developer received four years for deploying kill-switch malware; a 20-year-old “Scattered Spider” actor received ten years for multi-enterprise intrusions.  Courts emphasized willful damage under existing computer-fraud statutes.
- **Impact**: Reinforces the need for insider-threat programs, privileged-access monitoring, and evidence preservation to support law-enforcement collaboration.
- **Timeline**: Sentencings concluded; ongoing supervision periods imposed.
- **Affected Industries**: All sectors employing privileged developers or administrators.
- **Regulatory Body**: U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) / Federal courts.

## Compliance Requirements and Obligations

  - **Framework/Standard**: GDPR / UK Data Protection Act (implicit for UK-based Colt Technology Services)
  - **Implementation Details**: 72-hour supervisory-authority notification, customer communication, data-minimization during ransom negotiations.

- **AI Model Integrity Safeguards**
  - **Framework/Standard**: OWASP Top-10 for LLMs (guidance)  
  - **Implementation Details**: Model-selection controls preventing unintended downgrades, prompt-validation filters, audit trails of model calls.

- **K-12 Incident-Response Preparedness**
  - **Framework/Standard**: State education cybersecurity guidelines; NIST SP 800-61
  - **Implementation Details**: Written IR playbooks, tabletop exercises, multi-factor authentication for staff, and offline backups.

## Risk Management Developments

- **Risk Area**: Insider Sabotage & Privilege Abuse  
  - **Assessment Methods**: User-and-entity-behavior analytics (UEBA); zero-trust privilege reviews  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Least-privilege enforcement, continuous monitoring, exit-process kill-chains.

- **Risk Area**: Ransomware & Data Extortion (Colt / Warlock)  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Ransomware readiness assessments, attack-surface mapping  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Immutable backups, network segmentation, incident-response retainer agreements.

- **Risk Area**: AI Prompt-Injection & Model Downgrade (Comet browser, ChatGPT)  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Threat modeling of input channels, red-team simulations  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Input sanitization, content-security policies, model-version pinning.

- **Risk Area**: EV Smart-Charging Exploits (ISO 15118)  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Protocol-fuzz testing, supply-chain security reviews  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Certificate revocation procedures, anomaly-detection on charge-point networks.

- **Risk Area**: VPS Infrastructure Abuse  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Cloud asset discovery, autonomous threat-intel correlation  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Provider due-diligence, kill-chain disruption through rapid takedown requests.

- **Risk Area**: Workforce Displacement & Social Impact of AI  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Strategic workforce planning, scenario analysis  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Reskilling programs, ethical-AI governance charters.

## Governance and Oversight Changes

- **Governance Area**: Board Oversight of AI Risk  
  - **Requirements**: Establish AI-risk committees, receive regular briefings on model security and societal impact.  
  - **Accountability**: Chief AI Officer / Chief Risk Officer reporting to the board.

- **Governance Area**: Education-Sector Cyber Preparedness  
  - **Requirements**: Superintendent-level attestation on incident-response readiness; periodic audits.  
  - **Accountability**: District CIOs and school boards.

- **Governance Area**: Incident-Response & Law-Enforcement Liaison  
  - **Requirements**: Formal escalation paths and evidence-handling SOPs aligned with DOJ guidance.  
  - **Accountability**: CISO and General Counsel.
