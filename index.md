# GRC Intelligence Report

The past week’s coverage highlights a surge of security-driven compliance actions and governance guidance rather than formal statute-level rulemaking. Vendors issued multiple critical patches (Mitel MiVoice MX-ONE, Sophos Firewall, SonicWall SMA 100) that immediately translate into enforceable contractual or sector-specific obligations for operators of essential services. Threat intelligence uncovered new attack vectors—AI-assisted steganographic malware (Koske), loader-as-a-service operations (CastleLoader), BEC schemes aimed at aviation leaders, and espionage campaigns against VMware infrastructure (Fire Ant)—all of which elevate residual cyber-risk and trigger board-level oversight duties under prevailing cybersecurity and privacy frameworks. Meanwhile, the Wireless Power Consortium finalized the Qi2 25 W wireless-charging standard, introducing fresh product-safety and certification requirements for hardware manufacturers. Privacy-first browser changes (Brave blocking Microsoft Recall) and thought-leadership on translating cyber-risk for boards reinforce the increasing governance expectation that technical controls be coupled with clear executive accountability and risk communication.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

### Qi2 25 W Wireless Charging Standard
- **Description**: The Wireless Power Consortium announced the new Qi2 specification enabling 25 W wireless charging for smartphones and other devices. The standard introduces tighter alignment tolerances and enhanced power-management rules.  
- **Impact**: OEMs must update product design, testing, and certification processes to meet the Qi2 logo/market-access requirements. Suppliers need to ensure component compatibility.  
- **Timeline**: Rollout begins with certification labs in the “coming months” (exact effective date not published in the article).  
- **Affected Industries**: Consumer electronics, smartphone manufacturing, peripheral accessories.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Wireless Power Consortium (industry standard-setting organization).

### Brave Browser – Default Blocking of Microsoft “Recall”
- **Description**: Brave announced a browser-level control that prevents Microsoft’s Recall feature from capturing web activity, citing privacy protection.  
- **Impact**: Organizations that rely on Brave in managed environments inherit an additional data-minimization control and must update privacy notices and configuration baselines accordingly.  
- **Timeline**: Feature ships in the next stable Brave release; users can manually re-enable if desired.  
- **Affected Industries**: Cross-sector, especially organizations operating under GDPR/CCPA-like privacy regimes.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Not a formal regulator; driven by Brave Software, Inc. (relevant to compliance with data-protection laws).

## Compliance Requirements and Obligations

- **Mitel MiVoice MX-ONE Patch Deployment**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: Vendor security advisory aligns with ISO 27001 control A.12.6 (technical vulnerability management).  
  - **Implementation Details**: Apply Mitel-issued firmware update or workaround immediately; validate successful remediation through penetration or credential-bypass testing.

- **Sophos Firewall Critical RCE Fix (v19.5 MR3 and v20)**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: CIS CSC Control 7 (Continuous Vulnerability Management).  
  - **Implementation Details**: Upgrade to the patched firmware; restrict WAN access to the management interface; enable multi-factor authentication for admin accounts.

- **SonicWall SMA 100 Series Firmware Update**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: NIST SP 800-53 SI-2 (Flaw Remediation).  
  - **Implementation Details**: Move to the newest “Critical Patch” release; review remote-access logs for indicators of compromise.

- **VMware ESXi / vCenter Hardening Against “Fire Ant” Exploits**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: PCI DSS v4.0 6.3.3 (security updates for all system components).  
  - **Implementation Details**: Apply VMware security patches referenced in the article; disable unnecessary management ports; monitor for suspicious lateral movement.

- **Brave Privacy Control Configuration**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: GDPR Art. 25 (Privacy by Design/Default).  
  - **Implementation Details**: Document browser configuration as a technical safeguard in Records of Processing Activities (RoPA); educate users on implications.

- **Qi2 Certification Readiness**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: Product-safety and electromagnetic-compatibility testing protocols defined by WPC.  
  - **Implementation Details**: Engage accredited labs for Qi2 certification; update compliance files and supplier declarations of conformity.

## Risk Management Developments

| Risk Area | Assessment Methods | Mitigation Strategies |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| AI-assisted Steganographic Malware (Koske) | Memory analysis, YARA rules for image payloads, anomaly detection in process injection | Implement eBPF-based runtime monitoring on Linux hosts; block unverified image downloads on production servers |
| Virtualization Exploitation (Fire Ant vs. VMware) | Vulnerability scanning of ESXi/vCenter, review of management-plane logs | Patch to latest builds; restrict ESXi Shell & SSH; enforce network segmentation for management traffic |
| Supply-Chain Compromise of Software (Steam Early-Access Infostealer) | Software-Bill-of-Materials (SBOM) review, digital-signature verification | Adopt zero-trust code-provenance controls; isolate gaming/dev test environments from corporate network |
| Authentication Bypass in Unified Communications (Mitel MX-ONE) | Pen-testing of PBX login flows; CVSS score triage | Immediate firmware update; enforce least-privilege account use; monitor VoIP call-detail records |
| Loader-as-a-Service (CastleLoader) | Threat-intel feed correlation, sandbox detonation of suspicious installers | Block IoCs at secure web gateways; harden GitHub access with signed commits; run user-awareness campaigns |
| Business Email Compromise in Aviation Sector | Simulation phishing campaigns; financial transaction verification audits | Dual approval for wire transfers; DMARC, DKIM, SPF enforcement; escrow verification calls with customers |

## Governance and Oversight Changes

- **Board-Level Cyber-Risk Communication**  
  - **Requirements**: Security leaders must express cyber threats in business-impact and financial terms, as highlighted in “Translating Cyber-Risk for the Boardroom.”  
  - **Accountability**: CISO and CFO jointly responsible for aligning cyber-risk metrics with enterprise risk-management (ERM) dashboards.

- **Privacy-by-Default Browser Configuration**  
  - **Governance Area**: Data-protection oversight committees need to document the decision to deploy Brave’s Recall-blocking feature enterprise-wide.  
  - **Accountability**: Data Protection Officer (DPO) to monitor ongoing compliance and update record-keeping.

- **Patch Governance for Critical Infrastructure Components**  
  - **Governance Area**: Change-control boards must prioritize vendor critical patches (Mitel, Sophos, SonicWall) as “emergency changes.”  
  - **Accountability**: CIO/IT Operations with audit verification by Internal Audit.
