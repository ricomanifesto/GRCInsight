# GRC Intelligence Report

A surge in cyber-threat activity is driving immediate governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) attention across multiple sectors. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) expanded its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, creating a new federal mandate to remediate four actively exploited flaws.  High-impact vulnerabilities—most notably the Citrix “Bleed2” NetScaler defect (CVE-2025-5777) and weaknesses in TBK DVRs and Four-Faith routers—require rapid patching or compensating controls to avoid regulatory scrutiny and litigation exposure.  Identity-based attacks are increasingly breaching retail environments, while manufacturing plants are under pressure to eliminate default passwords on operational-technology (OT) devices.  Parallel developments include PayPal’s AI-driven fraud-interdiction capability, ransomware outages at Ingram Micro, and global investment-fraud schemes leveraging 17,000+ fake news sites—all of which underscore the need for stronger board oversight, continuous risk assessment, and prompt compliance action.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

### CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog – July 2025 Additions
- **Description**: CISA added four newly exploited security flaws to the KEV catalog after confirming in-the-wild attacks against federal and critical-infrastructure systems.  
- **Impact**: Federal civilian agencies must identify, prioritize, and remediate the listed vulnerabilities; private-sector companies operating federal contracts or critical infrastructure are strongly urged to follow suit.  
- **Timeline**: Each flaw carries the standard KEV remediation deadline stated in the CISA notice (specific dates provided in the notice itself).  
- **Affected Industries**: Federal government, critical infrastructure, technology providers, and any entity using the affected products.  
- **Regulatory Body**: U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).  

*No other explicit regulatory changes were cited in the source material.*

## Risk Management Developments

- **Identity-Based Threats in Retail**  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Privileged-access reviews, identity analytics, continuous monitoring of OAuth tokens.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Least-privilege enforcement, automated role mining, and third-party access certifications.  

- **DDoS Botnets Exploiting IoT Firmware Flaws**  
  - **Assessment Methods**: External attack-surface mapping, IoT vulnerability scanning.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Mandatory firmware patching, network segmentation, and DDoS scrubbing services.  

- **Fake-News Investment Fraud (“BaitTrap”)**  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Brand-abuse monitoring, dark-web intelligence.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Takedown of fraudulent domains, user-education campaigns, enhanced AML/KYC checks.  

- **Ransomware & Supply-Chain Disruption (Ingram Micro, SafePay strain)**  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Business-impact analysis (BIA), supplier-risk scoring.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Immutable backups, tabletop exercises, contractual incident-notification clauses.  

- **Cross-Platform Malware (Bert ransomware, Atomic macOS infostealer, NimDoor)**  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Endpoint detection & response (EDR) telemetry, threat-hunting.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Application whitelisting, user-awareness training, multi-OS patch management.  

- **KEV-Listed Vulnerabilities (Active Exploitation)**  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Continuous vulnerability scanning against KEV list.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Rapid patch deployment, compensating controls, post-patch validation.  

## Governance and Oversight Changes

- **Board-Level Cybersecurity Oversight**  
  - **Requirements**: Boards are advised to receive regular briefings on ransomware readiness and KEV compliance status, especially after the Ingram Micro outage and Qantas extortion.  
  - **Accountability**: Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) reports quarterly to the Audit/Risk Committee; board minutes should capture risk-treatment decisions.  

- **Third-Party Risk Governance**  
  - **Requirements**: Strengthen vendor assessments after Shellter-tool leakage and retail vendor-token misuse.  
  - **Accountability**: Procurement and Security Governance teams to maintain an approved-vendor list and monitor continuous controls compliance.  

- **Incident-Response Governance**  
  - **Requirements**: Update incident-response playbooks to include AI-assisted fraud detection and cross-platform malware scenarios.  
  - **Accountability**: CIO and CISO jointly responsible; must conduct at least one enterprise-wide exercise annually.  

## Industry-Specific Impacts

- **Retail**
