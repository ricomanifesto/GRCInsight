# GRC Intelligence Report

The past week delivered a heavy dose of vulnerability disclosures, vendor mitigations, and a single but very significant federal directive.  CISA’s emergency inclusion of Citrix NetScaler CVE-2025-5777 in the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog forces U.S. civilian agencies to patch within 24 hours, underscoring regulators’ growing impatience with lagging remediation.  At the same time, a surge of high-severity exploits (Fortinet FortiWeb, Wing FTP, Laravel APP_KEY, Bluetooth “PerfektBlue,” Google Gemini misuse, OpenVSX zero-day, and supply-chain compromise of WordPress Gravity Forms) raised the operational stakes for patch and third-party-risk programs.  NVIDIA’s guidance to enable system-level ECC on GDDR6 GPUs, Microsoft’s security engine swap in Windows 11, and industry commentary on passkeys, cyber-insurance, and AI data governance reflect continuing efforts to harden technology stacks while boards grapple with strategic cybersecurity oversight—particularly in finance and critical-infrastructure sectors.  Privacy concerns around digital fingerprinting and an eSIM design flaw round out a rapidly shifting compliance and risk landscape.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

### CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog – Citrix NetScaler “Citrix Bleed 2” (CVE-2025-5777)
- **Description**: CISA added CVE-2025-5777 to the KEV Catalog after confirming active exploitation of NetScaler ADC and Gateway appliances.  The agency issued an urgent directive requiring expedited remediation.
- **Impact**: Federal executive-branch agencies must identify all affected devices and apply the vendor patch or disconnect vulnerable systems.  Private-sector entities are strongly urged to follow the same timeline.
- **Timeline**: Patch or mitigate within 24 hours of catalog listing (one-day turnaround explicitly mandated for agencies).
- **Affected Industries**: U.S. federal agencies; enterprises running Citrix NetScaler in healthcare, finance, retail, and critical infrastructure.
- **Regulatory Body**: U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
