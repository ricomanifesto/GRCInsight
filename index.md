# GRC Intelligence Report

Recent cyber-crime prosecutions, large-scale data breaches, high-impact vulnerability disclosures, and the first major “quantum-safe” roadmap from a hyperscale vendor are re-shaping the GRC landscape. Organizations face heightened legal exposure after U.S. courts handed down multi-million-dollar sentences in SIM-swapping and hacktivism cases, while Orange Belgium’s breach of 850,000 customer records underscores continuing data-protection obligations. Security advisories from Apple (CVE-2025-43300) and the FBI/Cisco on a seven-year-old flaw show that patch management remains a mandatory compliance control. Microsoft’s 2033 quantum-safe program sets a de-facto benchmark for crypto-agility, and researchers warn of new ransomware (Warlock), AI-generated phishing sites (Lovable/Vibe abuses), and space-system vulnerabilities—expanding the risk register for boards and CISOs alike.
