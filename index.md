# GRC Intelligence Report

A surge of cyber-threat activity and vulnerability disclosures dominated this week’s GRC landscape. U.S. CISA expanded its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, compelling federal entities and their contractors to patch four newly listed flaws. Retailers are grappling with a sharp rise in identity-based attacks exploiting over-privileged accounts and dormant vendor tokens, while a new RondoDox botnet is hijacking unpatched TBK DVRs and Four-Faith routers to fuel DDoS campaigns that could disrupt industrial and public-sector operations. Large-scale fraud campaigns—such as the 17,000-site “BaitTrap” network—and PayPal’s deployment of AI-driven scam interception underscore heightened compliance expectations around customer protection and anti-fraud monitoring in financial services. Meanwhile, critical enterprise infrastructure faces escalating risk from the CitrixBleed2 vulnerability (public PoC now available), aggressive cross-platform ransomware (“Bert”), persistent macOS infostealers, and state-sponsored espionage operations (TAG-140, Batavia, Silk Typhoon). These developments reinforce the need for tighter governance over patch management, vendor access, incident response, and data-privacy safeguards across multiple industries.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

### CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog – July Additions
- **Description**: CISA added four security flaws to the KEV catalog, citing active exploitation in the wild. Inclusion in the KEV list designates the vulnerabilities as requiring priority remediation by federal civilian agencies.
- **Impact**: Agencies—and vendors that service them—must identify affected assets, apply vendor-issued patches or mitigations, and validate remediation. Organizations in critical infrastructure sectors commonly map their own vulnerability-management SLAs to KEV timeframes.
- **Timeline**: Specific patch-by deadlines are set for each vulnerability in the KEV notice; agencies must meet the dates stated by CISA.
- **Affected Industries**: U.S. federal government; contractors and suppliers to federal agencies; critical infrastructure operators that voluntarily follow CISA guidance.
- **Regulatory Body**: U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)

*No other explicit regulatory changes were referenced in the reviewed articles.*

  - **Implementation Details**: Deploy vendor patch immediately; verify through version checks; update WAF signatures; monitor for exploitation using provided IoCs.

- **Mitigate Identity-Based Threats in Retail**
  - **Framework/Standard**: PCI DSS principle 7 (least privilege) & 8 (strong access controls)
  - **Implementation Details**: Conduct role-based access reviews; remove dormant vendor tokens; enforce MFA on privileged accounts.

- **DVR & Router Firmware Updates (RondoDox)**
  - **Framework/Standard**: ISO/IEC 27002 control 8.27 “Secure disposal or re-use of equipment” (extended to IoT lifecycle)
  - **Implementation Details**: Apply latest firmware for TBK DVRs and Four-Faith routers; isolate legacy devices; disable unused services (e.g., Telnet).

- **AI-Driven Transaction Monitoring (PayPal)**
  - **Framework/Standard**: AML/CTF obligations under FinCEN’s transaction-monitoring guidelines; PCI DSS 12.10 “Incident Response”
  - **Implementation Details**: Integrate adaptive AI models to flag real-time payment anomalies; embed consumer “hold and confirm” workflows; log decisions for audit review.

- **Default Password Elimination in Manufacturing OT**
  - **Framework/Standard**: IEC 62443-3-3 requirement 4 “Use of unique credentials”
  - **Implementation Details**: Replace vendor default credentials during commissioning; deploy password-vaulting for shared OT accounts; maintain device inventory with credential status.

## Risk Management Developments

- **Risk Area**: Identity & Access Management Abuse (Retail)
  - **Assessment Methods**: Privileged account discovery, credential-usage analytics, periodic entitlement reviews.
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Least-privilege enforcement, MFA, session monitoring, routine token revocation.

- **Risk Area**: IoT Botnets & DDoS (Critical Infrastructure)
  - **Assessment Methods**: External attack-surface scanning for vulnerable DVRs/routers; traffic-pattern baselining.
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Firmware patching, network segmentation, rate-limiting, DDoS scrubbing services.

- **Risk Area**: Public PoC Exploits (CitrixBleed2)
  - **Assessment Methods**: CVE mapping, vulnerability scanning, exploit-attempt detection logs.
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Emergency patch rollout, virtual-patch rules on WAF, continuous attack-surface monitoring.

- **Risk Area**: Ransomware (“Bert”, SafePay) & Supply-Chain Disruption
  - **Assessment Methods**: Backup-integrity tests, RaaS intelligence feeds, third-party risk questionnaires.
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Immutable backups, EDR containment, tabletop exercises, contractual incident-notification clauses.

- **Risk Area**: Investment Fraud via Fake News Sites (BaitTrap)
  - **Assessment Methods**: Brand-monitoring services, takedown request tracking, social-engineering simulations.
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Rapid domain takedown escalation, consumer-awareness campaigns, partnership with law-enforcement.

- **Risk Area**: State-Sponsored Espionage (TAG-140, Batavia, Silk Typhoon)
  - **Assessment Methods**: Threat-intel correlation, spear-phishing simulations, geo-political risk assessment.
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Network segmentation for sensitive data, behavioral EDR, zero-trust access controls.

## Governance and Oversight Changes

- **Vulnerability Governance**
  - **Requirements**: Boards should require quarterly reports on KEV-listed exposure and patch compliance; establish “critical vuln” escalation paths.
  - **Accountability**: CISO and CIO jointly responsible; audit committee to review remediation metrics.

- **Third-Party Access Governance**
  - **Requirements**: Formal vendor-token lifecycle policy; periodic certification of least-privilege adherence for suppliers.
  - **Accountability**: Vendor-management office; overseen by risk committee.

- **Incident Oversight for Ransomware/Outages**
  - **Requirements**: Crisis-management playbooks covering operational disruption (e.g., Ingram Micro outage); board notification within pre-defined SLA.
  - **Accountability**: CIO (continuity) and General Counsel (regulatory disclosure).

- **AI Ethics & Fraud-Monitoring Governance**
  - **Requirements**: Establish AI-model governance to ensure transparency, bias testing, and compliance with consumer-protection requirements.
  - **Accountability**: Chief Risk Officer and Chief Compliance Officer, with oversight from data-ethics committee.
