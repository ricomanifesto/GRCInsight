# GRC Intelligence Report

Over the last week the GRC landscape was dominated by cyber-security–driven developments rather than classical regulatory rule-making. Government authorities and private platforms alike issued new security mandates, while a series of high-profile breaches and zero-day disclosures highlighted persistent control weaknesses across sectors. Key events include the Philippines’ decision to hard-wire zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) into its national e-voting infrastructure, Google’s new “Developer Verification” policy aimed at curbing Android malware outside the Play Store, and Citrix’s emergency fix for a zero-day (CVE-2025-7775) that is already under active attack. Simultaneously, ransomware and data-theft incidents at Farmers Insurance, Nevada state offices, Salesloft, and multiple healthcare facilities underscored the need for stronger incident-response governance, identity controls, and vendor‐risk oversight. Emerging threat intelligence—Silk Typhoon’s diplomatic campaigns, Hook Trojan’s ransomware pivot, and massive RDP scanning waves—adds urgency to patch-and-protect efforts across critical infrastructure, insurance, technology, and public-sector domains.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

### Philippines Zero-Knowledge Proof Election Mandate
- **Description**: The Philippines’ electoral authority is integrating zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) cryptography into its online voting system to strengthen ballot secrecy, voter authentication, and auditability.  
- **Impact**: Election commissions, technology vendors, and systems integrators must embed ZKP protocols in all software components and provide verifiable proof trails.  
- **Timeline**: To be operational for the next national election cycle (exact date not specified in the article).  
- **Affected Industries**: Government, e-voting solution providers, cybersecurity consultancies.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Philippine Commission on Elections (COMELEC).

### Interpol-Led African Cybercrime Disruption Initiative
- **Description**: Multiple African law-enforcement agencies, in partnership with Interpol and private-sector threat-intelligence firms, launched coordinated operations to dismantle cyber-crime syndicates operating across national borders.  
- **Impact**: Businesses operating in Africa should prepare for increased law-enforcement cooperation requests, data-sharing obligations, and potential seizure of malicious infrastructure.  
- **Timeline**: Ongoing; no fixed end-date provided.  
- **Affected Industries**: Financial services, telecom, and any sector handling cross-border data.  
- **Regulatory Body**: National police agencies in conjunction with Interpol.

## Compliance Requirements and Obligations

- **Developer Verification Program**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: Google Android Platform Policy  
  - **Implementation Details**: All Android developers distributing apps via sideloading must undergo identity verification; organizations should update secure-SDLC checklists and CI/CD pipelines to include Google’s verification steps.  

- **Citrix NetScaler Emergency Patch (CVE-2025-7775)**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: Vendor security bulletin / CVE program  
  - **Implementation Details**: Apply vendor-supplied firmware patch immediately, document change in configuration-management system, and validate via vulnerability scans.  

- **Password Manager Adoption for Business Users**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: NIST SP-800-63 password guidelines (implicitly referenced)  
  - **Implementation Details**: Deploy enterprise-grade password managers with SSO and MFA integration; revise acceptable-use policies to require vault usage.  

- **Healthcare Multifactor Authentication (MFA) Rollout**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: HIPAA Security Rule best-practice guidance  
  - **Implementation Details**: Implement MFA on all remote access points, especially EHR systems, and test fail-over procedures as part of business-continuity planning.  

- **Breach Notification and Customer Vigilance (Farmers Insurance)**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: State data-breach notification statutes (none specifically cited)  
  - **Implementation Details**: Notify affected users, provide credit monitoring, and retain incident records for statutory look-back periods.  

- **OAuth Token Revocation (Salesloft Incident)**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: OAuth 2.0 security best practices  
  - **Implementation Details**: Rotate compromised tokens, enforce least-privilege scopes, and update third-party-app vetting checklists.  

## Risk Management Developments

- **Remote Code Execution (Citrix NetScaler)**
  - **Assessment Methods**: CVSS scoring, external vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Patch immediately, restrict management interfaces, monitor for indicators of compromise (IoCs).

- **Ransomware in Healthcare**
  - **Assessment Methods**: Business-impact analysis focusing on patient-care continuity.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Immutable backups, MFA, tabletop exercises, and network segmentation.

- **State Government Cyber-Disruption (Nevada)**
  - **Assessment Methods**: Critical-services dependency mapping, cyber-resilience maturity assessment.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Incident-response playbooks, redundant communication channels, and cross-agency drills.

- **Diplomatic Targeting by Silk Typhoon**
  - **Assessment Methods**: Threat-intelligence correlation with MITRE ATT&CK techniques.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: DNS filtering, captive-portal hardening, and user-awareness on malicious redirects.

- **Mass RDP Scanning Waves**
  - **Assessment Methods**: Log aggregation and anomaly detection on port-3389 traffic.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Enforce VPN-only RDP, enable network-level authentication, and apply account lockout policies.

- **Hook Android Trojan Evolution**
  - **Assessment Methods**: Mobile-threat-defense telemetry, static and dynamic code analysis.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Deploy MTD solutions, enforce Play-Store–only installation, and educate users on sideloading risks.

## Governance and Oversight Changes

- **Election System Oversight**
  - **Requirements**: Establish a dedicated cryptographic-assurance committee to audit ZKP implementation.  
  - **Accountability**: National election boards and appointed third-party auditors.

- **Hospital Board Cyber Governance**
  - **Requirements**: Boards must review ransomware-preparedness scorecards and approve cyber-insurance coverage levels.  
  - **Accountability**: CIO/CISO with quarterly reporting to the Board Quality & Safety Committee.

- **AI Agent Adoption Governance**
  - **Requirements**: Gartner advises creating a cross-functional AI Ethics & Risk Council before deploying generative AI agents.  
  - **Accountability**: Chief Data/AI Officer with oversight from Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function.

- **Vendor & Supply-Chain Security**
  - **Requirements**: Update third-party-risk frameworks to include verification of OAuth token handling after the Salesloft breach.  
  - **Accountability**: Procurement and Security Vendor-Risk teams.
