# GRC Intelligence Report

A surge of high-severity software vulnerabilities and targeted enforcement actions dominated this period’s GRC landscape. Regulators – most visibly the U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) – accelerated patch-mandate timelines, while vendors such as Fortinet and NVIDIA issued urgent security guidance. Simultaneously, new attack vectors (eSIM, Bluetooth “PerfektBlue,” GPU “RowHammer,” AI-assisted phishing) highlight expanding risk surfaces across IoT, automotive, finance, and public-sector environments. Governance discussions focused on integrating cybersecurity into digital-finance strategies and leveraging cyber-insurance as a resilience tool, while several major data-exposure incidents (Nippon Steel, McDonald’s McHire) underscored ongoing privacy and internal-control gaps. Organizations must tighten patch management, revisit board-level cyber-risk oversight, and align security programs with rapidly evolving regulatory expectations.
