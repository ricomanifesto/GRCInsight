# GRC Intelligence Report

During the last news cycle, multiple high-impact security disclosures, vendor patches, and privacy enhancements created new governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) obligations for organizations worldwide. U.S. federal agencies must immediately integrate four newly-listed vulnerabilities into their CISA KEV remediation programs, while all enterprises should accelerate patching for Microsoft’s July 2025 Patch Tuesday release (137 flaws) and the critical Citrix NetScaler “CitrixBleed 2” (CVE-2025-5777). Browser-rooted risks surged, with 1.7 million malicious Chrome extension installs and a supply-chain compromise of the Ethcode VS Code extension. The looming industry move to 47-day SSL/TLS certificates requires governance attention to certificate inventories and automation. In mobile, Samsung’s forthcoming One UI 8 introduces stronger on-device encryption and privacy dashboards, but simultaneous discoveries of TapTrap UI attacks and the Anatsa banking trojan show that Android risk remains elevated. Retailers, banks, and technology distributors reported major ransomware, fraud, and credential-theft incidents, underscoring the need for tightened identity controls, third-party oversight, and cyber-resilience planning.
