# GRC Intelligence Report

Over the past week, GRC-relevant news has been dominated by a surge in cyber-threat activity, notable vulnerability disclosures, and expanding technology adoption trends that carry compliance implications. Law-enforcement action (Interpol’s “Operation Serengeti 2.0”) and Apple’s emergency patch for CVE-2025-43300 underscore an increasingly aggressive regulatory and enforcement climate around cyber risk. Simultaneously, state-sponsored campaigns (Murky Panda, Silk Typhoon, APT36) are exploiting cloud-trust relationships, firmware flaws, and Linux infection chains—highlighting the urgency of robust supply-chain and endpoint controls. Energy-consumption concerns surrounding AI workloads and Apple Intelligence’s unexpected data collection are pushing boards to refine ESG and privacy governance. Finally, Google’s move to eSIM-only handsets and the first U.S. phones with Bluetooth 6 introduce new telecom and product-safety compliance considerations.
