# GRC Intelligence Report

Over the past news-cycle, GRC activity has been dominated by a surge in cyber-enabled crime, vendor patching, and new organisational policies aimed at tightening consumer protection and data-handling practices. A U.S. federal indictment against members of the Chinese threat group “Silk Typhoon” underlines heightened legal exposure for state-sponsored hacking, while multiple large-scale breaches (Ingram Micro, Qantas, Allianz Life, LVMH) highlight the growing importance of incident-response readiness and breach-notification compliance. Security advisories from Apple and the open-source community (PyPI, WordPress) reinforce patch-management obligations, and YouTube’s rollout of AI-based age-verification shows major platforms updating governance controls to address youth-protection requirements. Across sectors, ransomware, sophisticated phishing, and supply-chain attacks remain the primary risk vectors, driving renewed emphasis on multi-factor authentication, code-integrity controls, and continuous third-party monitoring.

- **Description**: Korean authorities and security firms reported more than 250 fake applications laced with spyware that enabled blackmail schemes.  
- **Impact**: Local app stores and developers must conduct enhanced vetting, while organisations should reinforce mobile-device-management (MDM) policies.  
- **Timeline**: Active threat; ongoing takedown efforts.  
- **Affected Industries**: Telecom, financial services, and consumer mobile platforms.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) and law-enforcement partners.
