# GRC Intelligence Report

Recent weeks have delivered a flurry of high-impact governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) developments. Europe’s competition regulator imposed a multibillion-dollar fine on Google, underscoring ongoing antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an urgent directive compelling all Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies to patch a newly exploited Sitecore vulnerability by 25 September 2025. At the same time, critical security flaws surfaced in SAP S/4HANA and Argo CD, while Microsoft quietly switched on mandatory multifactor authentication (MFA) for every Azure tenant—creating an immediate compliance obligation for cloud administrators. Threat intelligence reports highlighted new malware (CastleRAT) and novel attack vectors in agentic AI systems and social-media advertising, reinforcing the need for updated risk assessments and identity-governance modernisation. Finally, a high-profile data breach at Canadian fintech Wealthsimple illustrated ongoing privacy-compliance and incident-response challenges for the financial sector.
