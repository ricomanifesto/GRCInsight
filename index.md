# GRC Intelligence Report

Over the last week, vendor-driven security mandates and newly disclosed threat activity have dominated the GRC landscape. Microsoft announced a compulsory roll-out of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for every Azure resource-management action beginning in October, signalling a shift toward “secure-by-default” cloud administration. Concurrently, multiple critical software vulnerabilities were patched, most notably a zero-click exploit in WhatsApp’s iOS/macOS clients and three chained flaws in Sitecore Experience Platform that enable remote code execution. Active exploitation is also accelerating: North-Korea-linked ScarCruft (APT37) is weaponising RokRAT in a phishing campaign against South-Korean academics, while the TamperedChef infostealer and abuse of the Velociraptor forensic tool illustrate the continued misuse of legitimate utilities and advertising channels for command-and-control (C2) operations. Together, these developments heighten compliance pressure around patch management, identity assurance, and third-party software governance across cloud, higher-education, and marketing technology sectors.

## Regulatory Updates and Changes

### Microsoft Azure Mandatory MFA Enforcement
- **Description**: Microsoft will require MFA for *all* Azure Resource Manager (ARM) operations conducted via the portal, CLI, PowerShell, or Terraform. Service-principal authentications are not affected.  
- **Impact**: Organisations must ensure every human operator (admins, DevOps, contractors) has an MFA method enrolled and that automation scripts do not rely on non-MFA user credentials. Conditional-Access and Identity Governance policies must be reviewed for conflicts.  
- **Timeline**: Enforcement begins October 2025; Microsoft states a gradual rollout but no opt-out once enabled for a tenant.  
- **Affected Industries**: All Azure-using sectors (finance, healthcare, public sector, SaaS providers, education, etc.).  
- **Regulatory Body**: Microsoft (vendor policy acting as de-facto industry requirement).

### WhatsApp Emergency Security Update
- **Description**: Meta released updates for WhatsApp on iOS and macOS to remediate a vulnerability exploited in targeted zero-day attacks enabling remote code execution via zero-click messages.  
- **Impact**: Enterprises with managed mobile endpoints must expedite patch deployment through MDM solutions and verify version compliance.  
- **Timeline**: Patch released; immediate installation advised.  
- **Affected Industries**: Organisations with BYOD or corporate WhatsApp usage, especially executive communications and customer-service channels.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Meta / WhatsApp.

### Windows Certificate Services Bug Fix
- **Description**: Microsoft resolved a defect that generated false CertificateServicesClient (CertEnroll) error messages after July 2025 preview updates, potentially masking genuine enrollment failures.  
- **Impact**: PKI administrators should apply the fix and re-validate certificate enrollment workflows to maintain audit-ready certificate management records.  
- **Timeline**: Fix available in current cumulative updates.  
- **Affected Industries**: All Windows-based enterprises that leverage Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS).  
- **Regulatory Body**: Microsoft.

### Windows 11 KB5064081 Preview Update
- **Description**: The update introduces 36 new features, including corrected Task-Manager CPU metrics and privacy-related “Recall” improvements.  
- **Impact**: IT teams must test for compatibility, update SOE baselines, and ensure telemetry settings align with internal privacy policies before broad deployment.  
- **Timeline**: Preview available now; production release expected in next “Patch Tuesday” cycle.  
- **Affected Industries**: Organisations standardising on Windows 11 24H2.  
- **Regulatory Body**: Microsoft.

## Compliance Requirements and Obligations

- **Azure MFA for Resource Management**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: Aligns with ISO 27001 A.9 (Access Control) and CIS Azure Foundations Benchmark.  
  - **Implementation Details**: Enforce MFA via Azure AD Conditional-Access; migrate scripts to service principals; update incident runbooks to include MFA prompts.

- **Urgent Patch Deployment – WhatsApp iOS/macOS**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: NIST CSF PR.PT-1 (Patch Management).  
  - **Implementation Details**: Configure MDM auto-update policies, block legacy versions at network egress, and document patch completion for audit evidence.

- **Sitecore Experience Platform Hotfix Application**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: PCI DSS v4.0 6.3.3 (security patches within vendor-defined timeframe).  
  - **Implementation Details**: Apply vendor-supplied hotfixes, test in staging, and deploy to production; update web-application firewalls to monitor cache-poisoning patterns.

- **Velociraptor & VS Code Execution Controls**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: MITRE ATT&CK defenses + SANS Critical Control 2 (Inventory and Control of Software).  
  - **Implementation Details**: Implement application allow-listing; restrict installation of forensic tools to authorised hosts; monitor outbound SSH and WebSockets traffic from VS Code processes.

- **Malvertising Defence for TamperedChef Campaign**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: CIS Control 9 (Email and Web Browser Protections).  
  - **Implementation Details**: Enable ad-blocking on corporate browsers; deploy DNS sinkhole for suspicious download domains; educate users on verifying software sources.

- **Certificate Services Error Fix Validation**  
  - **Framework/Standard**: SOC 2 CC6.3 (Change Management).  
  - **Implementation Details**: Patch domain controllers, run test enrollments, archive logs showing successful certificate issuance.

## Risk Management Developments

- **Risk Area**: State-sponsored Phishing & Malware (ScarCruft / RokRAT)  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Threat-intelligence feed correlation; spear-phishing simulation targeting academic departments.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Enforce MFA on email accounts, deploy sandbox analysis for inbound attachments, block exfiltration to cloud-storage C2 domains.

- **Risk Area**: Malvertising-Driven Infostealers (TamperedChef)  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Web proxy logs for unusual ad-redirect chains; endpoint telemetry for anomalous process spawn of `msiexec` from browser sessions.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Harden browser security settings, restrict local admin rights, and integrate reputation-based download controls.

- **Risk Area**: Abuse of Legitimate Tools for C2 (Velociraptor & VS Code)  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Behavioural analytics for lateral tool transfers; look-back scans for Velociraptor binaries in non-forensic environments.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Application control, network segmentation, and SOC playbooks for “Living-off-the-Land” detection.

- **Risk Area**: Zero-Click Messaging Exploits (WhatsApp)  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Mobile-threat-defence (MTD) telemetry; monitoring of crash logs indicative of exploit attempts.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Immediate patching, restrict sensitive discussions on consumer messaging apps, enforce enterprise E2EE platforms.

- **Risk Area**: PKI Integrity & Visibility (Windows CertEnroll bug)  
  - **Assessment Methods**: Audit certificate issuance events; validate OCSP/CRL distribution.  
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Apply fixes, run compliance scans for orphaned certificates, and update PKI documentation.
