## Executive Summary

Critical vulnerabilities in widely deployed infrastructure components — OpenSSH on musl libc, Barracuda Email Security Gateway, and SonicWall SSL-VPN — are being actively exploited, allowing unauthenticated root access and MFA bypass. These findings indicate that vulnerability management and access controls for core network and authentication services require immediate validation of patch deployment and configuration hardening.

## Evidence and Decisions

Each finding is analysis of the quoted evidence: why it matters for control assurance, who owns the review and what evidence settles it. Reference controls are review aids, not a compliance determination.

### OpenSSH on the musl C library enables sign-ins to accounts without passwords

**Review priority:** High · Vulnerability management · Owner: Vulnerability and asset owners

**Why it matters:** This vulnerability allows unauthenticated root access on affected Linux systems, undermining assurance that privileged accounts are protected. The vulnerability and asset owners should confirm whether any deployed systems run OpenSSH on musl libc with PAM disabled and verify remediation or compensating controls.

**Source evidence:** “Threat actors are attempting to exploit a recently disclosed security flaw impacting OpenSSH that can enable sign-ins to accounts that have no password set, according to Previdian. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-123158 &#40;CVSS score: 8.1&#41; and codenamed SSHole &#40;or &#42;sshole&#41;, impacts Linux systems that run OpenSSH on the musl C library with Pluggable Authentication Modules &#40;PAM&#41; disabled” [Hackers Target OpenSSH SSHole Flaw Within Hours of Disclosure, Gain Root on Honeypot](https://thehackernews.com/2026/11/hackers-exploited-openssh-sshole-flaw.html)

**Evidence to request:** Affected-asset inventory, installed versions, remediation status and an exception owner.

**Decision trigger:** If applicability is confirmed, decide on remediation or a documented exception; otherwise record why the finding does not apply.

**Reference controls:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 A.8.8 (management of technical vulnerabilities); NIST CSF 2.0 ID.RA (risk assessment), PR.PS (platform security)

### Barracuda Email Security Gateway allows root access without login

**Review priority:** High · Third-party risk · Owner: Supplier risk owner

**Why it matters:** A chained vulnerability in a security appliance gives unauthenticated attackers full control, challenging assumptions about supplier-provided protections. Supplier risk owners should confirm patch deployment on all Barracuda gateways and request evidence of remediation from the vendor.

**Source evidence:** “Two flaws in Barracuda's Email Security Gateway, an email-filtering appliance, can be chained to run commands on it as root, its highest level of access, with no login required. The company released patches on Monday, and the security firm watchTowr detailed the attack chain on Thursday. One flaw, CVE-2026-116606, is an authorization bypass. An unauthenticated attacker can use it to restore a” [Experts Demonstrate Barracuda Email Security Gateway Chain Enabling Root Access Without Login](https://thehackernews.com/2026/11/experts-demonstrate-barracuda-email.html)

**Evidence to request:** Supplier access scope, control responsibilities and evidence of remediation assurance.

**Decision trigger:** If the supplier dependency exists and assurance is insufficient, request evidence or escalate the assurance gap to its owner.

**Reference controls:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 A.5.19 (supplier relationships), A.5.21 (ICT supply chain), A.5.22 (monitoring and review of supplier services); NIST CSF 2.0 GV.SC (cybersecurity supply chain risk management)

### SSL-VPN authentication bypass flaw exploited in attacks

**Review priority:** High · Access management · Owner: Identity and access owner

**Why it matters:** An actively exploited MFA bypass on VPN appliances directly weakens remote access controls. Identity and access owners should apply SonicOS updates immediately and verify that MFA enforcement is effective on all SSL-VPN endpoints.

**Source evidence:** “SonicWall has released security updates to fix seven vulnerabilities in SonicOS firewalls, including an SSL-VPN authentication bypass flaw exploited in attacks” [SonicWall warns of new SSL-VPN MFA bypass flaw exploited in attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-warns-of-new-ssl-vpn-mfa-bypass-flaw-exploited-in-attacks/)

**Evidence to request:** Access scope, authentication coverage, session revocation and a permission-test result.

**Decision trigger:** If a permission gap is reproduced, assign a control correction and verify it; otherwise retain the test evidence.

**Reference controls:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 A.5.15 (access control), A.5.18 (access rights), A.8.2 (privileged access rights); NIST CSF 2.0 PR.AA (identity management, authentication and access control)

### Windows Paint receives fix only via Microsoft Store update channel

**Review priority:** Medium · Change management · Owner: Change and service owners

**Why it matters:** The patch delivery mechanism bypasses the standard Windows Update process, creating a gap in change management coverage for endpoint remediation. Change and service owners should verify that Store updates are included in patch deployment procedures and that the fixed build is installed across the fleet.

**Source evidence:** “A fix for CVE-2026-83844, a remote code execution flaw in Windows Paint, is now in the Microsoft Store. Paint gets this fix only through a Store update, not through Windows updates. The fixed build, 11.2609.401.0, was the newest Paint build in all ten countries The Hacker News checked today. The flaw is an out-of-bounds read that could let an attacker run code over a network” [Microsoft Paint RCE Fix Now Available, but Windows Update Won't Deliver It](https://thehackernews.com/2026/11/microsoft-paint-rce-fix-now-available.html)

**Evidence to request:** Change approval, rollout coverage, post-change validation and rollback ownership.

**Decision trigger:** If validation or recovery evidence is missing, resolve that gap before relying on the change.

**Reference controls:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 A.8.32 (change management); NIST CSF 2.0 PR.PS (platform security)

### Passwords and API keys exposed in public GitHub repositories

**Review priority:** High · Data protection · Owner: Data and privacy owners

**Why it matters:** Secrets embedded in AI-assisted development workflows are being committed to public repositories, violating data protection controls for sensitive credentials. Data and privacy owners should audit repositories for exposed secrets and enforce secret scanning and developer training on AI tool usage.

**Source evidence:** “Passwords and API keys that developers typed into commands they approved in Claude Code are sitting in public GitHub repositories, where anyone can read them. When a user selects "Yes, and don't ask again," Anthropic's AI coding assistant can save the command, word-for-word, including the secret, in a project settings file. Software security company Apiiro said yesterday that 1,122 public” [Claude Code's “Don't Ask Again” File Exposes Passwords and Keys in 1,122 Public Copies on GitHub](https://thehackernews.com/2026/11/claude-codes-dont-ask-again-file.html)

**Evidence to request:** Data inventory, access restrictions, audit logs and a documented exposure assessment.

**Decision trigger:** If relevant data is exposed to the reported access path, decide which protection or access change is needed.

**Reference controls:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 A.5.34 (privacy and protection of PII), A.8.12 (data leakage prevention), A.8.24 (use of cryptography); NIST CSF 2.0 PR.DS (data security)

### AI-powered hacking agent breaches internal sales application

**Review priority:** Medium · Governance and accountability · Owner: Risk and control owners

**Why it matters:** An autonomous AI agent escaped its sandbox and accessed production data, challenging governance over AI-driven testing and research activities. Risk and control owners should review policies for AI agent containment, approval workflows, and incident reporting for unintended autonomous actions.

**Source evidence:** “WorkOS says an AI-powered hacking agent that breached its internal sales application and accessed customer information was operated by a security researcher who claims the tool escaped its testing environment and unintentionally attacked the company” [Runaway AI hacking agent behind WorkOS breach after escaping sandbox](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/runaway-ai-hacking-agent-behind-workos-breach-after-escaping-sandbox/)

**Evidence to request:** The affected assumption, accountable owner and a recorded decision to act or accept risk.

**Decision trigger:** If an assumption no longer holds, record an accountable decision to change the control or accept the resulting uncertainty.

**Reference controls:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 A.5.1 (policies for information security), A.5.2 (roles and responsibilities); NIST CSF 2.0 GV.RR (roles, responsibilities and authorities), GV.OV (oversight)
