4) Risk Assessment
- High-likelihood, high-impact
  - Ransomware/data extortion: Trend rising. Gaps in EDR coverage, segmentation, and offline backups amplify impact.
  - Third-party/supply chain compromise: Trend rising. Contractual notification gaps and limited continuous monitoring increase exposure.
  - Cloud/IAM compromise: Trend rising. MFA fatigue and session token theft bypass traditional controls; misconfigurations in SaaS/IaaS.
- Medium-likelihood, high-impact
  - Data privacy non-compliance: Trend steady to rising. Data sprawl and incomplete inventories drive breach/notification risk.
  - API/application exploitation: Trend rising. Shadow APIs and insufficient runtime protection.
- Medium-likelihood, medium-impact
  - Insider threat and data exfiltration: Trend steady. Elevated with broad SaaS adoption and weak DLP.
  - Business email compromise and deepfake-enabled fraud: Trend rising. CFO/AP processes and voice verification weaknesses.
- Emerging and strategic
  - AI governance risk: Model/data lineage, prompt injection/data leakage, and explainability gaps.
  - Concentration risk: Over-reliance on few critical SaaS/Cloud providers without continuity alternatives.
  - Geopolitical cyber risk: Spillover effects on suppliers and infrastructure.

Key KRIs/KPIs to monitor
- Mean time to detect/respond (MTTD/MTTR) for high-severity incidents
- Percent of privileged identities with phishing-resistant MFA
- Critical SaaS/IaaS misconfiguration backlog and remediation SLA adherence
- Third-party critical vendor coverage with continuous monitoring and tested notification clauses
- Percent of internet-facing critical vulnerabilities remediated within SLA
- Data inventory coverage for regulated data; percentage with assigned owners and retention controls
- Completion rate of executive/board cyber disclosure tabletop exercises

5) Recommendations for Action
Immediate (0–30 days)
- Incident disclosure readiness
  - Run a 2-hour tabletop focused on third-party breach and disclosure decisioning; validate materiality criteria, legal sign-off, and regulator/customer comms templates.
  - Confirm 24/7 escalation roster and evidence-collection steps to support regulatory inquiries.
- Identity and access hygiene
  - Enforce MFA across all users; deploy phishing-resistant MFA for admins and remote access. Disable legacy/less secure protocols.
  - Audit privileged accounts; remove stale access and enforce least privilege.
- Vulnerability and exposure reduction
  - Patch/mitigate internet-facing critical CVEs; tighten remote access and RDP exposure.
  - Validate offline, immutable backups; perform a spot restore test of a business-critical system.
- Third-party risk triage
  - Refresh critical vendor list; confirm notification timelines, incident cooperation, and SBOM/secure SDLC commitments for key software suppliers.

Near term (30–90 days)
- Strengthen third-party assurance
  - Implement tiered due diligence, continuous monitoring for critical vendors, and incident-data sharing clauses. Pilot SBOM intake for top 10 critical apps.
  - Establish vendor exit/contingency plans for top concentration risks.
- Cloud and application security
  - Deploy CSPM and CIEM for high-value cloud accounts; remediate top misconfigurations. Introduce runtime API protection and API inventory.
  - Integrate SAST/DAST/SCA into CI/CD; retain evidence for audits. Define vulnerability SLAs by severity and asset criticality.
- Data protection and privacy
  - Complete data inventory for regulated data across SaaS/IaaS; implement retention and encryption standards. Update breach playbooks with multi-jurisdiction timelines.
  - Roll out DLP guardrails for high-risk channels (email, cloud shares, generative AI tools).
- Detection and response uplift
  - Expand EDR/XDR to all endpoints and servers; implement identity threat detection (token theft, impossible travel).
  - Integrate threat intelligence for sector-relevant indicators; tune for extortion TTPs.
- Governance and metrics
  - Establish cyber risk appetite statements and top risk KRIs; report monthly to the risk committee. Document board oversight activities.

Medium term (90–180 days)
- Zero Trust and segmentation
  - Define roadmap for network/identity segmentation, continuous verification, and device health checks. Isolate crown-jewel systems and OT networks.
- Resilience and continuity
  - Conduct cross-vendor resilience exercise simulating SaaS/IaaS outage; validate RTO/RPO and alternative workflows. Expand immutable backup coverage.
- AI governance
  - Create AI use policy, model inventory, and risk assessment framework; implement data minimization and human-in-the-loop for high-risk decisions.
- Contractual and policy modernization
  - Update standard vendor contracts with notification, audit, SBOM, and secure SDLC clauses. Refresh incident response, disclosure, and data retention policies.
- Insurance and assurance
  - Review cyber insurance adequacy against updated ransomware and business interruption scenarios. Map controls to underwriting questionnaires and evidence needs.

Execution guidance
- Ownership: CISO (technical controls, detection/response), CRO/ERM (risk reporting, appetite), Compliance/Privacy (disclosure and data), Procurement/Legal (contracts, vendor clauses), Business Units (process resiliency).
- Resourcing: Prioritize quick wins that reduce material impact (identity hardening, backups, disclosure/tabletops) while funding strategic initiatives (third-party continuous monitoring, CSPM/CIEM, API security).
- Evidence and auditability: Maintain artifacts of risk decisions, exercises, and control operation to demonstrate governance and support regulatory inquiries.

Bottom line
While no new regulations were identified in this period, the risk environment and supervisory expectations continue to intensify. Organizations that operationalize third-party oversight, disclosure readiness, identity/cloud security, and AI governance will reduce the likelihood of material incidents and strengthen defensibility with regulators, customers, and insurers.
