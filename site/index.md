5) Recommendations for Action
- 30-day priorities (stabilize and verify)
  - Run counsel-led tabletop for ransomware and third-party data breach, including disclosure and customer notification decisions.
  - Identify top 20–30 critical vendors; verify breach notification SLAs, security addenda, and contacts; ensure off-cycle attestations for those with elevated exposure.
  - Cloud/IAM hygiene sprint: remove stale accounts, enforce MFA for all admins, review high-risk permissions, block public storage unless approved.
  - Patch now: eliminate known exploited vulnerabilities on internet-facing systems; deploy virtual patching/WAF rules where needed.
  - Validate backup resilience: immutable storage, offline copies, and a recent test restore of a critical application.
  - Payment and access change controls: require out-of-band verification; alert for changes to vendor bank details.
- 60-day enhancements (build resilience)
  - Implement continuous vendor monitoring and require SBOMs for critical software; add right-to-audit and incident evidence-sharing clauses to templates.
  - Strengthen logging and detection: centralize logs for identity, cloud control plane, and critical apps; ensure retention aligns with regulatory expectations.
  - Data governance uplift: complete data maps for crown-jewel systems; tighten retention and deletion; remediate excessive access.
  - AI governance: inventory enterprise AI use cases; issue acceptable use policy, data redaction guidelines, and human-in-the-loop requirements for high-impact decisions.
  - Conduct business-impact analysis refresh and set impact tolerances for critical services; align recovery strategies accordingly.
- 90-day build-out (institutionalize)
  - Third-party concentration and exit planning: document alternatives for top providers; test at least one vendor failover or exit scenario.
  - Crisis communications and stakeholder engagement: finalize templates and approval flows for regulators, customers, and investors.
  - Penetration testing and purple-team exercises focused on identity, cloud, and vendor access pathways.
  - Privacy program maturity: automate consent and preference management; implement regular cookie/SDK scanning; validate cross-border transfer mechanisms with counsel.
  - Board reporting: update risk appetite statements, KRI dashboards, and residual risk views; tie investments to reduced loss expectancy.
  - Cyber insurance review: validate coverage for extortion, business interruption, and incident response vendors; align policy conditions with control reality.
- Governance and oversight
  - Establish a regulatory watch function to track emerging guidance on incident disclosure, AI governance, cloud/operational resilience, and privacy enforcement.
  - Embed risk ownership: assign accountable executives for third-party risk, cloud security, data protection, and AI governance; define control objectives and evidence requirements.
  - Internal audit coordination: schedule targeted audits on vendor risk management, incident response, and cloud/IAM controls; ensure issuances are remediated with deadlines.

Conclusion
Despite no newly issued regulations in the period, risk exposure is rising across sectors via third parties, extortion threats, cloud/IAM gaps, and AI use. Focusing on resilience, vendor oversight, identity and data controls, and disciplined incident disclosure will materially reduce loss and compliance risk. The above 30/60/90-day plan and governance measures provide a practical path to demonstrable improvement.
