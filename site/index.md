4) Risk Assessment
Top risk categories (likelihood/impact and notes):
- Ransomware and extortion: High likelihood / High impact. Data theft with double-extortion tactics; downtime and recovery costs.
- Third-party and supply chain: High / High. Concentration risk in MSPs, cloud, and payment processors; contractual and visibility gaps.
- Identity and access compromise: High / High. Phishing-resistant MFA gaps; token/session theft; privilege escalation.
- Cloud configuration and API abuse: High / Medium-High. Misconfigurations, excessive permissions, and insecure APIs.
- Data privacy and breach compliance: Medium-High / High. Multi-jurisdictional obligations; complex notification decisions.
- Operational resilience failures: Medium / High. Single points of failure; inadequate crisis communications and manual workarounds.
- Emerging AI/model risk: Medium / Medium-High. Data leakage, bias, unauthorized use; shadow AI tooling.
- Fraud and business email compromise/deepfakes: Medium-High / Medium-High. Social engineering and payment diversion risks.
- Regulatory and disclosure missteps: Medium / High. Materiality judgments under time pressure; inconsistent messaging.
Control coverage observations:
- Strengths commonly observed: Endpoint security, basic MFA, vulnerability scanning.
- Gaps commonly observed: Third-party continuous monitoring, API security, identity lifecycle/PAM rigor, disaster recovery testing frequency, structured disclosure workflows, comprehensive data mapping.

5) Recommendations for Action
Near-term (30–90 days)
- Governance and oversight
  - Reaffirm cyber risk appetite and incident materiality thresholds; align board reporting metrics to top loss scenarios.
  - Establish an executive Incident Disclosure Committee with legal, risk, security, IR, and communications.
- Incident response and disclosure
  - Build and test a disclosure playbook including decision trees, evidence retention, and regulator/customer templates.
