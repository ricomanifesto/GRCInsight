5) Recommendations for Action
Immediate (0–30 days)
- Governance and oversight
  - Reconfirm cyber/risk appetite statements; align KRIs (e.g., critical vulnerabilities >30 days, MFA coverage, restore success rate).
  - Establish or refresh a disclosure playbook with legal, IR, finance, and comms; define materiality criteria and approval workflows.
- Ransomware readiness
  - Validate immutable/offline backups for critical systems; perform a targeted restore test and document RTO/RPO results.
  - Run an executive tabletop focused on ransomware plus third-party outage; capture gaps and owners.
- Identity and email security
  - Enforce phishing-resistant MFA for admins and high-risk roles; close SMS/voice fallbacks.
  - Implement out-of-band verification for vendor bank changes and high-value payments.
- Third-party risk triage
  - Tier critical suppliers; ensure contracts include incident notification within defined hours, audit rights, and data handling terms.
  - Initiate continuous monitoring for top-tier vendors; confirm alternate supplier or contingency options.

Near-term (30–90 days)
- Cloud and application security
  - Deploy CSPM and secrets scanning in CI/CD; remediate high-risk misconfigurations and exposed keys.
  - Enforce least-privilege roles and just-in-time access for cloud admins.
- Vulnerability and exposure management
  - Adopt risk-based patch SLAs (e.g., known exploited vulnerabilities prioritized ≤7 days); integrate threat intelligence with asset criticality.
  - Implement external attack surface management for internet-facing assets.
- Data protection uplift
  - Complete/update data inventory and retention schedules; strengthen DSR workflows and breach notification procedures.
  - Apply encryption at rest/in transit and tighten access controls on sensitive datasets.
- Resilience and continuity
  - Update BCP/DR plans with realistic scenarios; test alternate communications and supplier failover.
  - Document recovery dependencies and single points of failure; assign remediation timelines.
- Evidence-based compliance
  - Centralize control evidence collection; standardize metrics and dashboards for audit readiness.
  - Align policies and standards with current control posture; close gaps identified in audits/assessments.

Medium-term (90–180 days)
- Zero trust and privileged access
  - Expand device posture checks, network segmentation, and PAM across critical systems; monitor for lateral movement.
- Software and supplier assurance
  - Require SBOMs and vulnerability disclosure programs from key software suppliers; integrate into procurement.
- AI governance foundations
  - Establish an AI use inventory, model risk assessment process, and human oversight checkpoints; implement guardrails for data use.
- Insurance optimization
  - Engage brokers early; map carrier control requirements to your roadmap (MFA, EDR, backups, logging) to secure coverage and terms.

Metrics and reporting (for board and executives)
- Cyber resilience: Mean time to detect/respond; backup restore success rate; RTO/RPO attainment by critical service.
- Control coverage: MFA/PAM adoption rates; EDR and logging coverage; CSPM critical findings aging.
- Vulnerability posture: Time-to-remediate for known exploited vulnerabilities; exposed internet-facing assets trend.
- Third-party risk: Percentage of critical vendors with continuous monitoring; contract clauses coverage; vendor incident response SLAs met.
- Compliance readiness: On-time completion of tabletop exercises, training completion rates, audit findings closure times.

By executing the above priorities, risk managers and compliance officers can materially reduce the likelihood and impact of prevalent threats, demonstrate regulatory readiness despite the absence of new rules in this period, and strengthen overall operational resilience and governance.
