    - Key indicators: Gaps in email authentication, weak payment verification, insufficient user awareness.
  - Operational technology (OT) and cyber-physical (Likelihood: Medium | Impact: High)
    - Business impact: Safety risks, prolonged outages, regulatory attention in critical sectors.
    - Key indicators: Flat networks, legacy systems, limited monitoring and segmentation.
  - Emerging tech and AI misuse (Likelihood: Medium | Impact: Medium-High)
    - Business impact: Data leakage, model integrity risks, compliance uncertainty.
    - Key indicators: Absence of AI acceptable use, model documentation, and vendor AI due diligence.

5) Recommendations for Action
- Governance, risk, and compliance
  - Establish or refresh cyber risk appetite statements, board reporting cadence, and materiality criteria for incident disclosure.
  - Tighten policy-to-control mappings and implement continuous control monitoring for high-impact domains (identity, backups, logging, vendor security).
  - Stand up a regulatory watch function to track enforcement actions and guidance; prepare a disclosure playbook (legal, IR, comms, security).
  - Define key risk indicators (KRIs) and targets: patch SLA adherence, privileged account coverage, MFA coverage, backup restore success, vendor due diligence completion, DSR SLA compliance.
- Third-party and supply chain
  - Tier critical vendors and perform event-driven reassessments; require minimum control baselines (MFA, logging, EDR, backups).
  - Strengthen contracts: breach notification timelines, SBOM provision, audit/pen-test rights, RPO/RTO commitments, AI/data usage clauses.
  - Implement continuous monitoring for critical vendors; monitor concentration risk and develop contingency plans for top providers.
- Technical controls and resilience
  - Identity-first security: Enforce MFA (including phishing-resistant where feasible), PAM for admins, periodic access recertifications, and detection for token abuse.
  - Cloud and data: Harden configurations via benchmarks; enable centralized logging; encrypt sensitive data; restrict public exposure; implement data discovery, classification, and DLP where proportional.
  - Software supply chain: Maintain SBOMs; enforce dependency scanning and signing; adopt secure build pipelines; define vulnerability SLAs by criticality.
  - Ransomware resilience: Test immutable backups and restore times quarterly; segment networks (especially OT); block known exfil channels; update EDR and isolation playbooks.
  - Detection and response: Validate coverage for endpoints, cloud, SaaS, and identity; define high-fidelity alerts; conduct quarterly tabletop exercises including legal and comms.
- Privacy and data governance
  - Complete data mapping for sensitive data and cross-border flows; implement data minimization and retention schedules.
  - Strengthen DSR workflows and breach assessment procedures; coordinate with legal on consent and transparency obligations.
- Training and culture
  - Targeted awareness on BEC, MFA fatigue, QR/smishing, and executive impersonation; run business-validated payment change verification training.
  - Define role-based training for developers (secure coding, OSS hygiene) and admins (hardening, logging, incident evidence handling).
- Program management and prioritization
  - 0–90 days: Close MFA and backup gaps; confirm high-risk vendor controls; finalize disclosure playbook; run ransomware tabletop; remediate critical internet-facing vulnerabilities.
  - 90–180 days: Implement continuous vendor monitoring; deploy least-privilege/IAM cleanup; roll out cloud posture management; pilot SBOM generation; establish KRIs dashboard to the board.
  - 6–12 months: Mature CCM and risk quantification; segment OT networks; integrate secure SDLC fully; negotiate enhanced vendor clauses at renewal; perform enterprise-wide crisis simulation.
- Evidence and assurance
  - Prepare audit-ready evidence packages for identity controls, incident response, backup/restore tests, and vendor due diligence.
  - Conduct independent validation (internal audit or third party) of control effectiveness in top risk areas.

Closing Note
While no new regulations were identified during this period, regulatory expectations and enforcement actions remain strong. Organizations that demonstrate clear governance, measurable risk reduction, and timely, accurate incident handling will be best positioned to reduce loss, meet compliance obligations, and sustain stakeholder trust.
